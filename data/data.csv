Negotiations continue among Assembly Democrats about what the final bill should look like.
The Assembly will try again to pass the bill out of the Assembly on Tuesday.
In response to the California PUC proposed order, which would retroactively end Direct Access on July 1, the Assembly amended its bill on Friday to include its own ""date certain"" for the temporary suspension of Direct Access.
The Assembly bill would now suspend Direct Access beginning August 25.

The Assembly will attempt to pass its version of the Edison MOU (SB 78) out of the Appropriations Committee today.
If and when that occurs, the Assembly will also attempt to get the bill passed out of the full Assembly today.
It will be a very long putt to get both accomplished today.
If and when the Assembly gets the bill out of the Assembly today, the bill will move over to the Senate, where the chances of passage are even more remote.
That said, Davis is making a full court press to get the bill passed out of both houses for his signature.
Will report back with the events of the Assembly.

He urges Lynch to immediately roll back the date to July 1.

Calif Energy Panel OKs First Step For 1160MW In Projects","10/18/2001
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

LOS ANGELES -(Dow Jones)- The California Energy Commission has accepted as ""data adequate"" applications to build a 900-megawatt power plant and two peaker plants totaling 260 megawatts, a press release said. 

The data adequacy vote means an application has been accepted as having sufficient information to proceed with the commission's approval process.

Enron Corp.'s (ENE) Roseville Energy Facility LLC unit has proposed building a 900-MW natural gas-fired plant in Sacramento, Calif., to be online by the fourth quarter of 2004. The construction cost will be $350-$450 million for the combined-cycle project, which will undergo a 12-month review process by the commission. 

GWF Energy LLC has applied to build the 169-MW Tracy Peaker Project, a simple cycle plant in the San Joaquin Valley, Calif., that would be online by July 2002. Peaker plants operate during times of high electricity demand. 

The company also applied to build the 91-MW Henrietta Peaker Project, 20 miles south of Hanford, Calif., which would consist of two turbine generators and come on line by June 2002. 

Electricity generated from the two peaker projects will be sold to the state's Department of Water Resources under a 10-year contract.

It is my hope that you and your loved ones have not been directly

I assume that the trip to Mendocino is still going forward. I am not
happy to report that my lower back has gotten worse and not better since
the accident in Hawaii. Sadly, I may have to pass on Mendocino. I will
find out more this upcoming week and let you know.

If I do have to cancel I would assume we should keep the Grandma's room
for Jeff & Lu. If there are any potential cancellation charges I should
pay to Lari please let me know. I have been looking forward to this for

and
ask him to reply to me).

I know some of you have ridden with Lari many times, but her scheduler
is
facilitating this process and has asked for some information.  Please
provide the following and I will batch and send to Lari:


Years riding
How often currently riding
type of riding (i.e. English lessons, dressage, trail)
type of saddle preferred
age, height and weight


Also, we initially planned on an all-day ride on Sat, and a four-hour
ride
on Sunday so we could all head back relatively early.  Lari would like
to
know where we want to ride on each day.  Nora is only riding for the
four-hour ride, and prefers the beach.  How about an all-day ride in the
redwoods on Saturday, with a four-hour beach ride on Sunday?


Amy

My only comment is that, in our view, the price cap (which would cover ALL capacity in the secondary market) is simply bad economic policy and won't address any problems--in fact it will only create problems. (From a practical perspective, I'm not even sure that the Commission can successfully ""regulate"" prices in the secondary market.)
 
Will the commission change the price cap provisions of the decision based comments advising against them?  Very unlikely.  
 
But when the caps create problems (and they will), I want to have been on record advising the Commission of why caps are bad economic policy and pointing out the bad outcomes that caps will cause.  I think that it's very important to point out the downside of caps and to be on record against them.  
 
That said, I don't want the comments to be so negative as to cloud support for the decision; nor do I think the Commission will change the cap based on our comments.  Other than that, EES and ENA can sign on.  Anyone have any objections to pointing out the fact that price caps are ill-advised?

Jeff

Enclosed for your review are the draft comments on the Revised Proposed
Decision in the Gas Restructuring Investigation.  WGSI and Enron have
indicated a desire to file supportive comments.  Edison has indicated an
interest in reviewing our draft for the purpose of considering joining in
our comments.  Please send edited electronic versions with underline and
strikeout to MBD at this address no later than noon tomorrow. These comments
must be filed tomorrow before 5 pm.  I am sorry for the lateness of the
draft, but these are not extensive comments.  Except for the little
bombshell about extending commission jurisdiction over gas marketers, I see
little in the RPD to warrant our opposition.  Even if the Commission
proceeds with the jurisdictional grab, I believe it can be overturned by the
Court of Appeals.

I look forward to your comments.

Thursday Morning session----Meeting with State Commissioners 


This session was generally known to be the occasion for state commissioners to vent their frustrations at FERC taking action without including them in the decision making process.  Although the panel notice showed that 5 state commissioners would attend, upon arriving in the hearing room we found that 27 state commissioners were there and ready to claim their 15 minutes of fame.  It was a long morning!  I will include comments or highlights from some of the commissioners below as well as some general thoughts. 

Approximately 35 to 40% of the commenters were supportive of FERC and urged them to keep moving forward with their efforts.  Most of these comments came from the Midwest and were somewhat muted or rational in their support.  Everyone else was fairly verbal against FERC, primarily citing that fact that they had been left out of the process, that FERC was moving too quickly, and there was no evidence that there was a benefit to their citizens.  In particular, the commissioners from Maryland and North Carolina delivered highly charged rhetoric. While many would think that the session was extremely negative (our friend Sarah Novosel thought it was disgusting!) in my mind it was similiar to a legislative hearing--allowing alot of whining and then addressing the main themes of discontent such as performing a cost benefit analysis.

Here's some individual comments: 

Catherine Riley/Maryland---she started out talking about the fact that she had taken a solemn oath to uphold the constitution when she joined the MAryland commission and immediately implied that FERC was not as diligent or honest as she was in upholding the values of protecting citizens (she was way overboard in the dramatics department).  She then stated that she was not at the meeting to ""help you (FERC) backfill your woefully inadequate evidentiary record"".  It went on like this for about 15 minutes.  The good part is that she was so personally negative, that her comments will not only be discounted but may be used against her.

Sam Ervin/NOrth Carolina---he was also very negative and he does not believe that there are any benefits to his citizens, that customer choice is never coming to his state, so he will never benefit from an RTO, that his current statutes do not allow any transfer of transmission to an RTO (and I bet if they do, he'll work to change the statutes!) and that the bulk of state commissions are not supportive of FERC. His comments were also pretty brutal, but sugar coated just a bit with southern humor.

Arnetta McRae/Delware---she kept on saying ""show me"" where the benefits for consumers are.  She also repeatedly talked about how short of a time frame they had to respond to the order.  

Rory McMinn/New Mexico---repeatedly talked about how the west was different, how he is not convinced that there is a benefit to his consumers, how the FERC commissioners needed to come out west to see how different they were. 

Carl Wood/California--tried to portray himself and California as representing the west as a whole, and even brought along a statement from the Washington commission echoeing his comments. He delivered the same messages that we've been hearing forever---FERC should have acted sooner on price caps, etc etc.

Glen Thomas/Pennsylvania---he was the first positive commenter and talked about how his state has taken great strides to bring it's energy system into the new century...that by opening it's markets they have had an explosion in green power, they have reduced costs all across the state, etc. He was very supportive of PJM (makes sense because it's in his back yard) and stated that for any RTO to be effective it must have independent governance.  

Judy Jones/Ohio---was very parochial in her discussion, but echoed Don Svanda's comments from earlier in the week that one RTO for the midwest was necessary and encouraged the FERC to make a decision and get on with it so that regulatory uncertainty would be removed.

Ed GArvey/Minnesota---he got the gold star for the day.  After very very lengthly comments from about 15 commissioners, he took about 1 minute and said ""FERC--just get it done""....in essence telling them to go ahead with what they are doing and move forward.

Other Commissioners who talked were:  Arthur/Connecticut, Hadley/Indiana, Huelsman/Kentucky, Nugent/ Maine  all on the positive side.  Other negative commentors were two guys from DC and Jim Irvin from Arizona who had a rambling conversation that never really pinpointed what he wanted to do.


From the FERC commissioner standpoint, the gold star went to Massey.  After hearing over and over again about how the commisioners didn't feel that they had been included and that FERC had not consulted them enough, he stated that he was going to express his frustration right back, saying the ""there has been 7 years of process, and he wants a process that comes to an end....you've been talking for 7 years and never could agree...""

??????? In response to the Commission's suspension of DA, numerous market participants--including Enron--filed ""Petitions for Rehearing.""

??????? The California PUC has issued a decision denying the petitions.

??????? Many of those participants are likely to file for appellate court review of the Commission's denial.

??????? In its decision denying the Petitions, the Commission did however modify its initial decision in several respects.

??????? Key among those is a modification regarding facility adds.  

??????? Those comments refer to the ability to continue to submit DASRs for new facilities under contracts signed prior to September 20th that provide for facility adds.

??????? The Commission agreed and has ordered the utilities to accept DASRs for facility adds under contract terms executed prior to 10.20.01.  The precise language is cited below.

??????? If you would like a copy of the decision, please contact Joseph Alamo.

Best,

Jeff

""We reaffirm that for the time being, and unless the Commission states otherwise in a subsequent decision, utilities are required to process DASRs relating to contracts or agreements that were executed on or before September 20th, 2001, including DASRs for service to new facilities or accounts if the underlying contract pursuant to which those DASRs are submitted allowed for the provision of that additional service.  Thus, for example, with respect to the specific ESP contract described by UC/CSU in their rehearing application, the utilities are required to accept, even after September 20, 2001, any DASRs they receive that legitimatley relate to that contract...[W]e want to make it clear that...utilities cannot set a deadline after which they could refuse to process DASRs relating to contracts executed on or before September 20, 2001.""  pp 20-21",36,862

Jeff,
Thanks, in advance, for your help with this.  The project is a ""Corporate Responsibility Stakeholder Perception Survey"" designed to gather baseline information on how our stakeholders view the issue of corporate social responsibility in general, and Enron in that regard in our major markets US, UK and Japan. Stakeholders are defined as those who are affected by our business, can affect our business or have an interest in Enron - customers, suppliers, governments, regulators, NGOs, employees, shareholders, etc.

What I would like from you is which stakeholders you think are important to include from Enron Corp's perspective here in California, and the job title or name therein. Please just take 5 minutes or so to list them, don't spend any longer than that.

CPUC - who?
CEC - who?
any others... 

I already have the major environmental organizations, but if you think TURN or others should be included, let me know.

I was talking to one of my customers yesterday, and they said that Southern California Gas Co. recently made a filing to revive unbundling of their system.  Can you tell me if that is true .  Also can you tell me what the status is regarding Socal Gas purchasing natural gas for the  needs of SDGE's customers.  My customers tell me that is probably going to happen as well.

Subject: PG&E's Gas Accord II application 
Importance: High 


Today, October 9, 2001, Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&E) filed an 
application with the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC). 

In this application, PG&E proposes a market structure and rules for the 
northern California natural gas industry, beginning 
January 1, 2003.  PG&E's filing was in response to a recent Commission order 
(Decision 01-09-016), which directed PG&E to file a ""Gas Accord II"" 
application.

*********************************************************************
Fallout in California
 


PG&E remains in bankruptcy 

The company's proposed plan of reorganization places the bulk of its gas and electric assets under FERC jurisdiction, leaving distribution under control of the California PUC


The California PUC and Edison reached agreement designed to keep Edison out of bankruptcy

On the heels of a failed legislative effort to return Edison to solvency, the California PUC has agreed to a rate plan to permit Edison to pay its creditors


The Davis administration still can't agree on a plan to use utility rates to reimburse the State's General Fund and pay for long-term power contracts

California used about $12.5 billion of taxpayer dollars to buy power on behalf of the state's cash-strapped utilities and signed more than $45 billion in long-term contracts

Unless California devises a plan to finance its foray into the energy business, California could turn its energy crisis into a fiscal crisis


California suspends the only successful piece of its failed restructuring scheme--customer choice

Fearful that customers will find better prices for power than it can provide, the State decided to temporarily suspend Direct Access in California and force customers to remain with the utility

The suspension is very controversial, prompting market participants to threaten litigation in the attempt to get Direct Access reinstated in California",,303,0

I reminded Kip that the only reason anyone's given to suspend DA is the urgent need to issue the bonds, but now, even the Treasurer has admitted that there is no urgency to issue the bonds.
I told Kip that the letter to Loretta should say 1) there is no longer any need to suspend DA whatsoever, 2) the PUC should commence ratemaking proceedings immediately to ensure that there is no cost-shifting to small rez and biz customers as a result of DA and 3) the PUC should deliver to the Legislature a study recommending any enhancements, modifications, etc. that should be made to the program to ensure that DA is maintained while ensuring that granny is not harmed.

He said he would see what he could do and said that he would likely get back to us.

Fielder agreed to sit down and talk as soon as we'd like.
He said that his ""legal and tariff guys"" told him that ""they're on solid ground""; but John admitted that doesn't mean that Edison ""is right.""
I told him that his lawyers and tariff people may think they're on solid ground with the PUC, but that in no way means that an appellate or (""god forbid) bankruptcy judge will concur with either Edison or the PUC.
I stressed that we weren't interested in meeting to re-hash our respective positions and that we wanted a meeting where we and they come to the table with constructive, good faith options to resolve the issue.
He said that he'd be willing to do that (though most deeply discount anything Edison says these days).
He suggested that we start without lawyers.  I said that we could do that, but that I'd have to check.
I told him that we'd try to get back to him sometime today regarding what we'd like to do.

		""The Administration does not project that the State will
need to make additional State loans to support the DWR Power Supply
Program even if DWR does not issue its revenue bonds as planned during
the 2001-02 fiscal year. DWR projects that its funds on hand at the date
of this Official Statement and projected revenues appear to be
sufficient to finance the Power Supply Program. The cash needs of the
Power Supply Program depend, among other things, on future power
purchase costs, the timing and amount of revenues from power sales, the
availability of additional interim loans, and the timing of the issuance
of revenue bonds by DWR. The Power Supply Act limits loans and advances
from the State under the Power Supply Act after November 15, 2001, to
amounts required for short-term cash flow purposes of no more than $500
million in the aggregate and requires repayment within 180 days.
However, the Governor has the power under the Emergency Services Act to
order additional loans or other advances to DWR if needed to further
mitigate the emergency.

			The State expects to maintain adequate cash
reserves to fund its normal operations during the 2001-02 fiscal year
whether or not DWR repays the State loans during the fiscal year. The
State plans to issue short-term notes to assure that adequate cash
balances are maintained. The State has regularly issued short-term debt
in the past to meet its cash flow needs. See 'State Indebtedness-Cash
Flow Borrowings.'""

31, 2001, $5,700,000,000 State of California 2001-02 Revenue

As best we can tell, if the PUC suspends, it will suspend DA effective today, September 20th.
In addition, there is a considerable effort underway--from both ends of the spectrum--to persuade the PUC to reject 1) the proposed rate agreement between the PUC and DWR and 2) the proposed ""revenue requirement"" that DWR submitted to the PUC.

Leslie -- Funny you should ask.  Columbia of Ohio called 51 OFO/OMO days last winter.  Other Columbia companies ( C of Penn., C of VA) did likewise.  Attached is a confidential draft complaint from our attorney in Ohio that I believe provides the info you seek.  Also attached is the Complaint filed by Hess,et al in Pennsylvania against Columbia there.  The facts and allegations are essentially the same:  confiscation/interruption of banked gas during OFO; OFO called for economic, not operational  reasons; heavy penalties for failure to deliver full MDQ; etc. 
My recollection is that Peoples and NorthShore called few, if any OFOs last winter.  Ditto for Nicor. I have a call in to those that know first hand about these latter three utilities so I'll forward that answer as soon as I receive it.
Please call if you have any questions or if can be of further assistance.

	PG&E, Socal	
	NIGAS, Peoples (Chicago), Northshore
	Columbia of Ohio

This is a good starting point for now.  Just so you know, we need this data as we are trying to verify/set/modify (whatever you want to call it), the price curves being set by the traders reflecting LDC risk.  Obviously, the frequency of OFOs will affect our risk of doing business on a particular LDC, so we need to try to compare and access charges associated with each.

Should I contact Tim Hamilton, or have you already done this?  Also--if you could help me find where in the websites the information is, that would be helpful.  Is it just the OFO tariffs that are on the websites or is there actual data on how often they have called OFOs, when they were called, etc. also published?

Greetings Colleen:
I'm not sure who's still working on this and who's not, but sometime back, we did a very extensive effort with Tim Hamilton and the rest of the EES team to get all information compiled regarding OFOs behind PG&E and SoCalGas.  I'm hoping that that information still exists so we can hopefully avoid recreating the wheel.  If, for some reason, the information is lost, the good news is that all OFO tariffs are compiled and easily retrievable on the SoCalGas' and PG&E's websites.  Please let me know how else we can help.

Leslie -- Funny you should ask.  Columbia of Ohio called 51 OFO/OMO days last winter.  Other Columbia companies ( C of Penn., C of VA) did likewise.  Attached is a confidential draft complaint from our attorney in Ohio that I believe provides the info you seek.  Also attached is the Complaint filed by Hess,et al in Pennsylvania against Columbia there.  The facts and allegations are essentially the same:  confiscation/interruption of banked gas during OFO; OFO called for economic, not operational  reasons; heavy penalties for failure to deliver full MDQ; etc. 
My recollection is that Peoples and NorthShore called few, if any OFOs last winter.  Ditto for Nicor. I have a call in to those that know first hand about these latter three utilities so I'll forward that answer as soon as I receive it.
Please call if you have any questions or if can be of further assistance.

First thing he has to do is convince Davis' lawyers that his companies' client list (which includes TW) shouldn't conflict him out of working on DWR gas deals.
He should have that figured out by this week--sounds like he may have to make some decisions about his current client list and working for DWR.
I told him that we'd like to sit down as soon as possible to discuss opportunities for us to help out DWR with its gas needs.
He said that he'd be happy to do that, once he's got all conflict issues worked out with the Governor's office.
He's going to get back to me to set up a meeting; and if I don't hear from him by Monday/Tuesday of next week, I'll call him back to set up a meeting.
I'm assuming that you'd be part of that meeting?
I asked him what sort of deals they're working on. As you likely know, some of the contracts permit DWR to either 1) provide gas to the plant providing DWR power under the power contract or 2) manage the plant's fuel supply.  So they're looking to get ""soup-to-nuts"" supply service for those contracts that include a fuel-supply option.

PACIFIC GAS AND ELECTRIC COMPANY AND PG&E CORPORATION FILE PLAN OF REORGANI=
ZATION=20
Plan Pays Claims in Full, Does Not Call for Retail Rate Increases or State =
Bailout
(San Francisco, CA)- PG&E Corporation (NYSE: PCG) and its utility unit Paci=
fic Gas and Electric Company jointly filed a Plan of Reorganization in U.S.=
 Bankruptcy Court today that enables Pacific Gas and Electric Company to pa=
y all valid creditor claims in full and emerge from Chapter 11 bankruptcy p=
roceedings. The official creditors' committee supports the plan.
""This plan is an achievable solution that will enable Pacific Gas and Elect=
ric Company to move out of Chapter 11 as a financially strong business posi=
tioned to continue safe, reliable and responsive delivery of gas and electr=
icity to its customers, pay all valid creditor claims in full, and do so wi=
thout asking for a rate increase or a state bailout,"" said Robert D. Glynn,=
 Jr., Chairman of Pacific Gas and Electric Company and Chairman, CEO and Pr=
esident of PG&E Corporation.  ""And, the plan will enable us to provide long=
-term growth prospects to shareholders."" =20
The plan reorganizes Pacific Gas and Electric Company and PG&E Corporation =
into two separate, stand-alone companies no longer affiliated with one anot=
her. The reorganized Pacific Gas and Electric Company will continue to own =
and operate the existing retail electric and natural gas distribution syste=
m.  The electric generation, electric transmission, and natural gas transmi=
ssion operations currently under Pacific Gas and Electric Company will be p=
art of PG&E Corporation. The common shares of the reorganized Pacific Gas a=
nd Electric will be distributed to PG&E Corporation shareholders.
The electric generation, electric transmission and gas transmission operati=
ons, when reorganized as new businesses under PG&E Corporation, will have t=
he ability to issue debt that will be combined with new financing at Pacifi=
c Gas and Electric and used to help pay creditors' claims. The plan also re=
structures certain existing debt and uses $3.3 billion in cash on hand to s=
atisfy creditor claims.=20
Under the plan, all valid creditor claims will be paid in full, using a com=
bination of cash and long-term notes.  In total, the plan will provide cred=
itors with about $9.1 billion in cash and $4.1 billion in notes. The vast m=
ajority of creditors-those with allowed claims of $100,000 or less-will rec=
eive cash payments for the full amount of their allowed claims on the effec=
tive date of the plan.  Most secured creditors will also receive 100 percen=
t of their allowed claims in cash.  Finally, unsecured creditors with allow=
ed claims in excess of the $100,000 threshold will be paid 60 percent in ca=
sh and 40 percent in notes.
 =09Following the restructuring, Pacific Gas and Electric Company and PG&E =
Corporation will be organized as follows:=20

?=09Pacific Gas and Electric Company will be a separate California corporat=
ion focused on providing electric and natural gas distribution service to i=
ts customers in Northern and Central California.  It will hold 70 percent o=
f the current utility assets (in terms of book value) and will employ 16,00=
0 people.  Pacific Gas and Electric Company will continue to provide the fu=
ll range of utility services to one out of every 20 Americans. =20

?=09PG&E Corporation, in addition to its existing National Energy Group bus=
iness, will have three new businesses that will own and operate the electri=
c generation, electric transmission and gas transmission operations formerl=
y under Pacific Gas and Electric Company.=20

The new electric generation business will be a California company establish=
ed to own and operate the hydroelectric and nuclear generation assets and a=
ssociated lands, and to assume the power contracts with irrigation district=
s, now held by the utility.  In total, the unit will have approximately 7,1=
00 megawatts of generation.  The facilities will be operated in accordance =
with all current FERC and Nuclear Regulatory Commission licenses, and in ke=
eping with sound environmental stewardship policies.  The generating busine=
ss will sell its power back to the reorganized Pacific Gas and Electric Com=
pany under a 12-year contract at a stable, market-based rate.=20
The new electric transmission business will be a California company establi=
shed to own and operate the transmission system currently operated by the u=
tility.  The system comprises 18,500 circuit miles of electric transmission=
 lines and cables.
The new gas transmission business will be a California company established =
to own and operate the natural gas transmission assets currently operated b=
y the utility, including 6,300 miles of transmission pipelines and three ga=
s storage facilities. =20
Following the reorganization, the California Public Utilities Commission wi=
ll continue to regulate the reorganized Pacific Gas and Electric Company, i=
ncluding retail electric and natural gas rates.  The Federal Energy Regulat=
ory Commission (FERC) will continue to have jurisdiction over the licenses =
for the hydroelectric assets, and the rates, terms and conditions of servic=
e provided by the electric transmission business.  FERC will also assume ju=
risdiction over rates for the power generated by the Diablo Canyon Nuclear =
Power Plant, and over the rates, terms and conditions of service for the ga=
s transmission system, which will become an interstate pipeline. =20
Glynn said, ""This plan, without raising retail rates, provides a safe, reli=
able and long-term electric supply to California customers.  It enables our=
 company to maintain a qualified workforce.  And it enables us to keep our =
generating assets intact and integrated, rather than selling them piecemeal=
 to pay creditors.""
The company expects that roles and responsibilities for the vast majority o=
f its workforce will be unaffected by the plan. The reorganized Pacific Gas=
 and Electric Company and the newly established entities will employ essent=
ially the same people who operate the various assets under the current orga=
nization.=20
""We envision essentially the same experienced, dedicated team continuing to=
 do their jobs with a comparable level of pay and benefits programs,"" said =
Glynn.  ""We believe these businesses should be operated and maintained by t=
he people who know how to run them best.""
In addition to resolving creditors' claims and maintaining stability for cu=
stomers and employees, the plan also provides long-term benefits to the sta=
te.  It provides the state with a path to exit the business of buying power=
 for customers, by identifying conditions under which Pacific Gas and Elect=
ric Company would be financially able to re-assume the procurement responsi=
bility that is currently being fulfilled by the state Department of Water R=
esources.
The Chapter 11 process requires that the plan of reorganization ultimately =
be confirmed by the Bankruptcy Court before it can be implemented.=20
Paul Aronzon, legal counsel for the Official Committee of Unsecured Credito=
rs, said ""This plan provides a comprehensive and responsible framework to r=
esolve creditors' claims and restore PG&E's creditworthiness.  It has our f=
ull support, and we look forward to an expeditious resolution of the Chapte=
r 11 process.""=20
""With this plan filed,"" said Glynn, ""we are now focused on bringing the Cha=
pter 11 process to completion, reaffirming the financial health and creditw=
orthiness of our operations through this reorganization, restoring customer=
s' confidence, and rebuilding value for our shareholders.""

Likely to get to those items on the agenda within the next 30-60 minutes.
Looks as if the decision will 1) suspend DA beginning Sept. 20th and 2) include contract renewal in the suspension.  
In addition, it appears that the proposal would give the Commission some latitude to enact retroactivity back to July 1 if deemed necessary (this is unclear and we're trying to get more details on this provision).
Three key senators have sent a a letter to the PUC asking the PUC to provide recommendations to the Legislature on the conditions under which DA should be re-instated (since the letter is dated September 18th--though sent only yesterday--it appears that the Senate had an idea that the PUC was going to suspend).

Attorney-Client Privileged Communication 

Steve, 

Rick asked me to send you an email regarding a contact with top SCE management about our Complaint against SCE for removing our ""Negative CTC Credits"" from our current bills.   While we have filed a Complaint with the CPUC and are withholding payments, the CPUC may not act until it is too late to recoup our credits (because our contracts with have expired).  As you know, there is a view among some at the CPUC that the Negative CTC Credits can only be recovered as a bill offset, and is not a cash obligation.  Therefore, SCE restoring the credits to the bills may be the only means to realize our $125 million account receivable.

Today Richard Sanders reported that Reliant, Mirant and others were soliciting Enron's participation in an involuntary filing (to be filed possibly as soon as tomorrow).  Is there any merit in contacting SCE top management and offering to trade our nonparticipation for restoration of our Negative CTC Credits to our bills?

Please call me if you wish to discuss.

Jeff,

My biggest concern is that we draw attantion to our QF contracts and there is pressure for us to give up our capacity payment or the CPUC futher dilutes our energy payment. I also don't think it makes sense to attack the large companies that have the DWR contracts. We generally end up working together on various issues and I do n't want to damage the relationships. I agree with many of the points John makes, but I don't want to be identified with the letter.

Enron Wind also needs to see an Edison MOU bill passed so we can get paid our past due amounts and get our five year fixed energy price on our ISO4 contracts. I plan to be in Sacramento the next couple of days and will stop by Governmental Advocates.

Subject: DA Suspended, but NOT retroactively


The Commission has just voted 3-2 to approve the draft ALJ Barnett decision=
, modified to be prospective only.  There is NO retroactive suspension.
=20

Carl Wood introduced the ALJ's draft decision, with a diatribe against dire=
ct access.  He said that DA is a subsidy from less attractive customers to =
large customers and an example of the saying that, ""big dogs eat first and =
big dogs eat best.""  He added that most comments advocated delay of suspens=
ion and no retroactivity.  He said he ""finds it hard to consider these comm=
ents to be anything but misleading and disingenuous.""  He added that, ""Smal=
l consumers effectively have no options.""  He said retroactivity will be th=
e subject of further review, although it was not clear what this meant.  Wi=
thin 14 days, the UDCs must inform the Energy Division of steps taken not t=
o accept DASRs for contracts entered into after 9/20/01.  He said that dire=
ct access is half of the failed deregulation process; the other half was op=
ening ourselves up to the erratic wholesale market.  He said that supporter=
s of DA engage in ""hollow rhetoric.""  The market has failed in the state, a=
nd, ""We need to put an end to the lack of social responsibility in the elec=
tric market.""

He concluded that several commenters had indicated that direct access was a=
 way for making green power available to residential customers.  He respond=
ed that this just means other customers are getting more dirty coal-fired p=
ower.  He concluded that advocates of direct access make a ""fraudulent clai=
m of customer choice."" <?xml:namespace prefix =3D o ns =3D ""urn:schemas-mic=
rosoft-com:office:office"" />

Commissioner Bilas then spoke for his alternate, responding to Wood.  He sa=
id he had learned how to count, and he can count to three.  He then briefly=
 summarized his alternate.  First, he expressed disappointment in the Sacra=
mento process and the fact that they had not yet done something to rescue d=
irect access.  Second, he indicated his view of DA was a lot different from=
 that of other people.  He said he had always opposed the AB 1890 provision=
 that instituted the UDC buy-sell arrangement, saying that it eliminated th=
e largest customers from direct access.  Commissioner Duque then spoke brie=
fly to indicate his support for the Bilas alternate draft decision and his =
strong support for direct access.=20

Commissioner Brown said first, ""In the weight of these sad times we must ob=
ey.  We are paying the price of the severe energy crisis which occurred las=
t year and the extraordinary means that were used to resolve it.""  In an or=
dinary market, he thinks DA is good, but there is no way it can coexist wit=
h the State's $22 billion worth of bonds.  Therefore, there is no question =
that it has to be suspended.  ""We probably should have done so months ago, =
in order to avoid a last-minute stampede.""  There is an inequity between cu=
stomers that have moved to opt for direct access and those who have not.  B=
ut sometimes ""you don't have a lot of good choices, and this is one of thos=
e times.""  ""If future legislation comes forward, and we hope that it would,=
"" the Commission will attempt to revise this action.  =20

President Lynch noted the State Senate leadership has written asking for a =
study to be delivered by 1/1/02 as to how DA can be maintained without bias=
 to ratepayers and she supported this action.=20

Bilas and Duque indicated they will both file dissents.=20

In conclusion, we have prevailed in our opposition to retroactive direct ac=
cess suspension.  We now need to consider whether we want to contest the su=
spension itself, on legal/procedural grounds.

Hey there!

How are you?  How's your summer? I'm nearing the end
of summer school and cannot wait til it's over. The
class has been a new low point in terms of educational
value-it sucks! ...in fact, I'm in class now.

Work is fine-not thrilling.  Again-I'm thinking about
taking advantage of Sun's flexible work deal and
moving back up to the city. I do not like the south
bay much.

Trying to get a happy hour together in August...are
you around?

Let me know how you are...
Courtney

Hi Jeff,

I'm looking at your transcript and you've already completed 30 
units.  You're taking 7 units this semester for a total of 37 units.  You 
need 40 units to graduate.

You may want to consider adding a 3-unit this semester.  Or next semester 3 
units will cost about half, $6000.  4 or more units full price.  Just let 
me know if you want to add another class, but you may not have the time!

Just ask at our front desk, and we'll make you a copy of your latest 
transcript.

You can go to the Deals class tonight, even though you're #17 on the 
waiting list.  I'll update the status on Friday.  You may want to have a 
back-up!

See you,
TJ

The Assembly will now attempt to get the bill out of the Appropriations committee today or tomorrow--the expectation is that the bill will make it out of that committee.
When and if the bill makes it out of the Appropriations committee, the Assembly will attempt to pass it out of the full Assembly.
If it makes it out of the full Assembly, it will then go to the Senate for approval, where the leader of the Senate, John Burton, continues to say publicly that the chances of passage in the Senate are slim.
On the PUC front, efforts are underway to stop the PUC from passing the proposal it issued last week.  
The current PUC proposal would suspend DA retroactive to July 1.
In conversations with the Governor's point people in charge of getting the bill passed, they indicated that they are aware of the problems with the PUC proposal and are working to resolve it.

Subject:	California Update--08.27.01

The California PUC
Loretta Lynch held a press conference in Sacramento today to discuss changes to the Commission's previously released proposal regarding Direct Access and the rate agreement between the PUC and DWR.
In the amended proposal discussed and distributed today, Direct Access would end retroactive to July 1.  Customers with contracts executed as of July 1 would would remain Direct Access customers.

The Legislature
The Assembly version of the Senate MOU (SB 78) has not yet been reviewed and voted on in the Committee.
It is scheduled to be reviewed and voted on at 6:30 PM PDT today.
Amendments on Direct Access were released this afternoon (based on negotiations between Davis' office and business customers):
Customers who have consistently been DA since May 2000, including those ""involuntarily"" returned to bundled service, would be exempt from charges for Edison's undercollection, DWR's forward contracts, and DWR-related exit fees, provided that the PUC finds that no additional stranded costs are created for Edison's remaining customers.
Customers who have consistently been on DA between May 2000 and Jan 17, 2001 would be exempt from charges for Edison's undercollection, DWR's forward contracts and DWR-realted exit fees, provided that the PUC finds that no additional stranded costs are created for Edison's remaining customers.
Customers who have been on DA between Jan 17, 2001 and August 24, 2001 would be exempt from exit fees related to DWR forward contracts, provided that the PUC finds that no additional stranded costs are created for Edison's remaining customers.
Customer's leaving after August 24th would not qualify for exemptions.
There is considerable work underway to make the August 24th date the deadline for contract execution, rather than the date by which the customer must be DASR'd, in order to qualify for the exemptions.
Direct Access would not be suspended, however, until 90 days after the bill is signed by Davis (if he signs it), i.e., the ""effective date"" of the bill.
So anyone going to Direct Access between Aug 24 and the effective date would not qualify for any exemptions.
After the 90-day period, DA would be suspended until 1.1.03.
Self-gen in service consistently from May 200 to August 24 would be exempt from Edison's undercollection and DWR charges.
Self-gen that submitted an application to the Energy Commission by August 24 would be exempt from DWR charges beginning the date that the self-gen comes on line.
Self-gen that comes on line after August 24 would be exempt from DWR charges beginning the date that the self-gen comes on line, but the total number of exempt MWs in this category would be limited to 250 MWs per year, on a first-come-first-serve basis.
At least 30% of any increases in net short due to increases in demand would be reserved for self gen.",306,824

The Assembly Energy, Costs and Availability Committee heard and voted on 
amendments to SBX2 78 proposed by many interested parties.  Some passed,

members.  Eventually the committee stalled on detailed proposals made by 
TURN and other consumer groups.

Richard Katz from the Governor's office regarding a couple of issues 
highlighted by Jeff and Mike Day.  Richard said he is willing to make more 
technical amendments when the bill gets to Appropriations.  Subsequently, 
Hedy and I spoke to D.J. Smith at Jeff's request.  D.J. agreed that the bill 
needs to use the August 24th date as a grandfather date for executed DA 
contracts, but specifically asked that we (Enron) not speak to Richard about 
it.  He said he will have the business entities request it as a clarifying 
amendment.  If we request it, he thought Richard would be less likely to 
believe it's clarifying since he believes our motives to be too 
self-serving.  Also, we spent some time with Lenny Goldberg on direct 
access.  We suggested that ""shall"" be changed to ""may"" in order to give more 
leeway to the PUC on direct access suspension.  He didn't necessarily oppose 
the policy, but his position is not to amend a bad bill unless you can

A lobbyist for a significant generator told us that they are prepared to

Subject:	Timing for QF meeting with Edison

Jeff - I believe we currently on scheduled for a September 13th conference call with John Fielder to discuss QF proposals.  One of the concerns I have is that the timing is such that it is unlikely, given the legislative session end of September 15th(??), that we are going to get much traction.  (Aside from the fact that it seems difficult to convey the nuances of this deal over a conference call).  It may not be relevant in this environment, but this idea makes sense.  It is an issue of who will listen and who will act.  It seems to make sense to propose the structure to DWR.  Given the dilemma of how to marry both the Utilities' revenue requirement with that of DWRs on a go forward basis, anything that proposes to lower a portion of either of these revenue demands should be addressed.  

The proposal to DWR could go as follows:  Either  Edison and PG&E could separately participate in the dual auction process to buy out the QF agreement and replace with market energy or the contracts could be assigned to DWR and DWR could conduct the dual auction.  Assignment of the contracts to DWR would be contingent on a successful auction process.  A buyout of the high priced QF agreements would provide for added head room under the rate caps and thus provide a basis for the higher cost DWR contracts.  

In addition, it appears for our analysis, the savings would be such that you could roll in the outstanding debt owed to the QFs and not exceed the existing payment to the QF under the current capacity plus SRAC pricing.  As such it seems that it could be construed as a restructuring of contracts and not a BAIL OUT of SCE.  (I say this because my understanding of SB 78 is that a portion of the debt is to pay the back payments owed QFs.  Is this portion of the bill being viewed by the radical contingent as a bail out?)

Let me know your thoughts.

A few thoughts:
Conference calls on issues of this size don't generally seem very constructive, and I'd suggest that we push for a face-to-face with Edison.
If the Legislature doesn't get the MOU out well in advance of September 14th, Edison won't be focused, and I'd suggest that we try and reschedule.
No matter the forum, the proposal will be tough to get through, even though it makes alot of economic sense.  It's a big change, and big changes don't come easy, no matter the benefits.  That said, no shots, no ducks.  We ought to make a push.
The proposal may not be contingent on Legislation. It might be possible to make it happen at the California PUC.
Assignment to DWR would be significant and might require legislation (need to ask a QF lawyer).
The proposal makes sense for both the IOUs and DWR, since both want as much ""headroom"" as possible in rates to cover their respective revenue requirements.
Given the pending rate agreement between the CA PUC and DWR, and the utilities' messed-up financial position, DWR is clearly the preferable counter party from credit perspective.
All that said, none of the above matters much unless the utility, a critical mass of QFs and the PUC's consumer advocate (""ORA"") buy into the idea.
I'd propose that we continue with Edison. If Edison bites, then go jointly with Edison to persuade the QFs. If the QFs bite, then go jointly with Edison and QF to try to persuade ORA.
On the issue of sleeving through the IOU or DWR, it seems useful to remain flexible on that, though absent general support from the IOUs, QFs and ORA, the entity will be academic.

Some preliminary thoughts.  Happy to discuss further.

Best,
Jeff

Subject:	Timing for QF meeting with Edison

Jeff - I believe we currently on scheduled for a September 13th conference call with John Fielder to discuss QF proposals.  One of the concerns I have is that the timing is such that it is unlikely, given the legislative session end of September 15th(??), that we are going to get much traction.  (Aside from the fact that it seems difficult to convey the nuances of this deal over a conference call).  It may not be relevant in this environment, but this idea makes sense.  It is an issue of who will listen and who will act.  It seems to make sense to propose the structure to DWR.  Given the dilemma of how to marry both the Utilities' revenue requirement with that of DWRs on a go forward basis, anything that proposes to lower a portion of either of these revenue demands should be addressed.  

The proposal to DWR could go as follows:  Either  Edison and PG&E could separately participate in the dual auction process to buy out the QF agreement and replace with market energy or the contracts could be assigned to DWR and DWR could conduct the dual auction.  Assignment of the contracts to DWR would be contingent on a successful auction process.  A buyout of the high priced QF agreements would provide for added head room under the rate caps and thus provide a basis for the higher cost DWR contracts.  

In addition, it appears for our analysis, the savings would be such that you could roll in the outstanding debt owed to the QFs and not exceed the existing payment to the QF under the current capacity plus SRAC pricing.  As such it seems that it could be construed as a restructuring of contracts and not a BAIL OUT of SCE.  (I say this because my understanding of SB 78 is that a portion of the debt is to pay the back payments owed QFs.  Is this portion of the bill being viewed by the radical contingent as a bail out?)

Let me know your thoughts.

Subject: CRITICAL!! IMMEDIATE REVIEW NEEDED 


THE COMMISSION HAS ISSUED A REVISED DRAFT OF THE BARNETT DECISION TODAY
WHICH RETROACTIVELY SUSPENDS DIRECT ACCESS TO JULY 1.
 
The cover letter states as follows:  
 
""This version differs from the draft mailed on August 15, 2001 in several
ways. First, the effective date of the suspension has been changed from
September 1, 2001 to July 1, 2001 (as proposed in the draft mailed June 15,
2001). Second, the draft decision clarifies that customers who have executed
direct access contracts prior to July 1, 2001 may continue to receive power
from electric service providers for the initial term of the contracts.
Several other editorial and explanatory changes have also been made. 
 
Assembly Bill No. 1 from the First Extraordinary Session (AB1X) requires
that direct access be suspended until the Department of Water Resources no
longer supplies power to the customers of the three largest regulated
electricity companies. It directs that the Commission determine the
effective date of the suspension. In order to reduce the possibility of harm
to customers and to resolve potential conflict, parties should comment on:
(1) whether AB1X suspends the entire direct access program, including all
transactions under that program, (2) how the Commission can comply with AB1X
if it exempts written contracts for direct access executed before July 1,
2001 from the suspension, and (3) whether July 1, 2001 is an appropriate
date for the suspension......Comments on the draft decision are permitted.
Those comments are to be electronically served on the service list (for
those who have electronic addresses) no later than 10:00 a.m. on September
4, 2001, and shall be filed with the Commission by 5:00 p.m. on that date.""
 
The specific wording in the Decision is:
 
""The Legislature has directed this Commission to suspend direct access until
DWR no longer procures power for the retail end-users, and we find it should
be suspended effective July 1, 2001.  The Legislative direction is clear;
and the suspension should apply to SCE, Pacific Gas and Electric Company
(PG&E), and San Diego Gas & Electric Company (SDG&E).  In the interest of
providing cost stability for current direct access customers, written
contracts for direct access signed before July 1, 2001 are exempt from the
suspension for the initial term of the contracts.""
 
It also provides that:

""In comments on the draft decision, several parties questioned the need for
the Commission to implement the legislative suspension of direct access as
soon as July 1, 2001.  By the draft decision mailed for comment to the
parties on June 15, 2001, market participants were provided notice that
direct access would be suspended as of July 1, 2001.  The Commission
postponed its consideration of the draft decision.  However, we do not
change the effective date of the suspension.  The underlying legislation was
introduced on January 3, 2001, enrolled and sent to the Governor on February
1, 2001, and signed by the Governor the same day.  Market participants have
now had eight months since then to prepare for this event.  We do not wish
to reward customers who have switched to direct access since July 1, 2001 in
the hope that we would change the effective date of the suspension when this
switch could disadvantage customers who continue to receive bundled service
from the utility."" 

The decision also states that no parties have raised any factual issues
which would justify hearings, which presumably, although not explicitly,
disposes of the joint AReM/WPTF filing.  I presume we will want to file in
strong opposition.  Suggestions on strategy?  It might be a good idea to
have a conference call on this and get started immediately with raising a
movement to counter this.

The following energy bills will be heard today.

SBX2 78 (Polanco/Sher), SCE MOU, will be heard by the Assembly Energy, Costs
and Availability Committee upon adjournment of the Assembly Transportation
Committee (approximately 2:30 p.m.) in room 437.  Late Friday, Assemblyman
Hertzberg informed his caucus that the Assembly may take this measure up on
the floor as early as today.  Because floor session is currently scheduled
for 11:00 a.m. this would require the Assembly to reconvene late this
afternoon, however, this has not been scheduled and such an action would
likely interfere with several Assembly fundraising events this evening.

SBX2 1 (Soto/Scott), windfall profits tax, will be heard by the Assembly
Revenue and Taxation Committee at 1:30 p.m. in room 126.

SB 532 (Sher), renewable portfolio standard, will be heard by the Assembly

It was held only after Brown insisted that it be held and only after Loretta
took a voice vote to over-rule Brown's hold.  Duque and Bilas joined Brown
in taking the item off the agenda.  I saw Brown this morning.  He's pissed
and he called Loretta a liar.  Somehow, he knew what was going to happen and
he prevented it.

Sue Mara is working with the ARM coalition to appeal yesterday's order and is taking the lead generally on the effort to reverse things.
The appeals that we would join, and attempt others to persue on their own, would focus principally on two issues:  1) disabusing the PUC of the notion that it has the legal authority to nullify contracts retroactively, and 2) lifting the suspension on DA altogether (let me know if I've missed anything here, Sue).

Enron Accused of Infringing Electronic Trading Patent (Update2)
2001-09-21 16:39 (New York)

Enron Accused of Infringing Electronic Trading Patent (Update2)

     (Adds company comment in seventh paragraph.)

     Marshall, Texas, Sept. 21 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp., the
largest energy trader, and its online unit are accused in a
lawsuit of infringing a Texas company's patent for an electronic
trading system.

     Bid/Ask LLC of Baird, Texas, formerly called Auction Source
LLC, said it is the sole rights owner of a patent issued in May
2000 for a ``Real-time Network Exchange with Seller Specified
Exchange Parameters and Interactive Seller Participation.''

     Houston-based Enron and its EnronOnline unit are improperly
using that patented technology through its Internet-based
electronic trading facility, according to the lawsuit filed Sept.
17 in federal court in Marshall, Texas. Enron trades commodities
such as natural gas and electricity on that trading network.

     Bid/Ask seeks a court order blocking Enron from infringing
the patent, and is asking for damages.

     EnronOnline began trading electricity and natural gas in
November 1999. Between then and the second quarter of 2001, it's
handled more than 1 million transactions valued at more than $685
billion, the company has said.

     Enron, which also trades space on fiber-optic networks, coal,
paper and other commodities, had net income of $979 million on
revenue of $100.8 billion in 2000.

     ``We have not reviewed the suit, so we can't comment on it,''
said Enron spokesman Vance Meyer.

     Shares of Enron fell 9 cents to $28.30 today.",,434,0

Subject: CPUC Initiating Rulemaking on ""Integrated Resource Planning""
Importance: High


The IEP Regulatory Affairs Committee over the past few weeks has been
discussing the prospects of state agencies (e.g. the CEC) pursuing a
long-term (1-2 year) strategy of re-introducing centralized, Integrated
Resource Planning in California.  Indeed, some CEC staff have used sought to
obtain planning/modelling authorities that could lead to dispatch
instructions or, perhaps, identification of generation units for
""retirement.""

The CPUC is opening a rulemaking (OIR) to return to ""integrated resource
planning.""  The BRPU returns!  Anyway, we will be discussing this further at
the Regulatory Affairs conference call next Tuesday.

We will provide additional information on the OII as soon as it becomes
available.

Subject: highlights from CPUC meeting
Importance: High


FYI.  Highlights from today's CPUC meeting.  It is still in progress,
with few energy items remaining.  Regular results memo to follow.

CPUC opens new rulemaking to return to ""integrated resource planning""
with contemplation of process that sounds much like the discredited
Biennial Resource Plan Update (BRPU) proceeding.  Clearly contemplates
utility construction of new generation projects, but also calls for
life-cycle cost analysis of all options, including new asset
construction, power purchase agreements, conservation, transmission,
etc.

CPUC rejects new interstate transmission facilities as not needed for
reliability purposes (lines to NV, AZ and MX).  Will begin new phase re
economic projects.

CPUC rejects request for clarification regarding QF contract
amendments.  Parties had requested clarification from CPUC decision
based on language in Admin Law Judge (ALJ) ruling that stated extensions
could go forward until the Commission acts.  CPUC states that parties
remain free to negotiation changes, but that they must move forward on
ordinary review process.  This decision primarily undermines QF contract
amendments with SCE's.

CPUC rejects PG&E's call for market valuation of retained generation.
PG&E argued that CPUC must use market value of retained assets to set
cost of service rates.  CPUC rejects argument.  Duque will concur, but
notes that there are outstanding issues including the likelihood that
CPUC will fail to meet statutory deadline to market value retained
assets, and fact that PG&E still has stranded cost recovery rights that
require market valuation.  It is also unclear, notwithstanding the CPUC
settlement with SCE, how post-transitions period costs will be recovered
per that agreement.

I think that California needs to make a final decision on whether it wants competitive markets or not.  I wonder if PURPA has anything to say about meeting incremental Utility needs and what that does to the CDWR contracts?

I don't see Enron getting engaged in this quagmire unless there is a clear business reason.

Subject: CPUC Initiating Rulemaking on ""Integrated Resource Planning""
Importance: High


The IEP Regulatory Affairs Committee over the past few weeks has been
discussing the prospects of state agencies (e.g. the CEC) pursuing a
long-term (1-2 year) strategy of re-introducing centralized, Integrated
Resource Planning in California.  Indeed, some CEC staff have used sought to
obtain planning/modelling authorities that could lead to dispatch
instructions or, perhaps, identification of generation units for
""retirement.""

The CPUC is opening a rulemaking (OIR) to return to ""integrated resource
planning.""  The BRPU returns!  Anyway, we will be discussing this further at
the Regulatory Affairs conference call next Tuesday.

We will provide additional information on the OII as soon as it becomes
available.

Greetings, Comrades, and welcome back (for two thirds
of you, and for you first years:  don't forget to
breathe).

I am compelled (Diane Dimeff stands behind me with a
Louisville Slugger slapping menacingly against one
palm) to tell you that Haas has a Complaint
Department, namely the Student Advisory Committee
(SAC).  

The SAC is a formalized conduit for presenting the
School Administration with your thoughts, suggestions,
responses, recommendations, kisses and hugs of
appreciation as well as rants and rodomontades of
angry frustration on any subject with respect to your
experience at Haas.  We do this by means of the
Student Survey (more on this later), our distinguished
teacher awards (more on this later, too) and by
listening to you when all others have grown weary of
your whining.   

The Committee  currently consists of the following
students (we are looking for a couple of
representatives from among the first years, but more
on this later, as you probably suspected):

Eric Jordan, jordan@haas.berkeley.edu
Lesley Keffer, keffer@haas...
Sujan Punyamur, punyanur@haas...
Deepika Shah, dshah@haas...
Joseph Tambornino (me), Chairman, tamborni@haas...

Feel free to flag any of us down (especially Deepika
since she's the easiest to talk to) if you have a
gripe, a brainstorm, or a question about Haas that
Diane and her team have not already triaged for you. 
(Be forewarned, however: we will not reveal the secret
formula to Berk's Finance case.)

Best wishes in reacclimating yourself to school.  (At
least it gives you something to do if the dotcom bust
has left you ""downsized,"" ""rightsized,"" ""laid off"" or
otherwise dumped by your old employer.  Heck, who
needs them anyway?  Go start your own digital
revolution.)

Quick side bar:  Edison is very concerned about TURN getting a stay from the court on the EIX/PUC settlement .
At the start of the call, Fielder said that he'd fax me the judge's ruling in the TURN appeal, but based on how the call went, I'm not sure if he'll send it. 
As we conjectured sometime back, Edison is indeed talking about charging us (through a reduced PX credit) for our ""share"" of the undercollection.
Our ""share"" would be paid down through a reduction in the PX credit over the life of the settlement (presumably about 2-3 years).
In short, with one hand Edison would pay us what they owe us; with the other hand, Edison would take it back.
Edison intends (as we conjectured) to base the amount of the undercollection owed by DA customers on the percentage of load they represent (e.g., if DA is (was) 10% of the load, they would pay for 10% of the undercollection).
We had a very ""animated"" discussion that went back and forth for some time.  
I told him that there's been some gross misunderstanding since his proposal simply doesn't track.
Fielder said that they believe their argument is solid.
Here's how we left it--he's going to get back to us by COB today or tomorrow and tell us what Edison's calculation is of our ""share"" of the undercollection.
We can discuss further on the call that Wanda's setting up for tomorrow.

Jeff, thanks again for attending the discussions with DWR.

Do you have any recon.... on exactly which plants DWR has the right to bring the fuel on. As Mark indicated, it was about 1/3 of their exposure, and most of that was in the south service area, but I am very interested in the actual facilities and whom used to bring fuel to them or run the units.'

There is a zero sum game on fuel... but the landscape changes depending on who buys it and how they buy it!

Subject: CPUC question


Jeff --
 
First of all, I wanted to thank you for your positive comments to Karen about my work on behalf of Enron.  She asked me to stay on board on an hourly, as-needed basis while they try to figure out what will happen next year.  Although I don't expect much work, it's certainly better than being cut out completely and she mentioned that you had appreciated my help during the contempt negotiations.  
 
I don't envy Karen for her job at the moment.  I've been getting the clips and Houston doesn't look like a fun place to be right now.  I also don't think they're planning too far in advance.  Yikes!
 
I've got a couple of CPUC questions for you.  What's the process for making a presentation in regard to either a specific case on the agenda?  Is it simply a matter of being present during a public hearing, or is there a list of witnesses/commentors that you have to get on?  The reason I ask is that I've been approached by a potential client regarding some telecommunications/broadband issues, with an appearance at the CPUC as a news hook.
 
How far in advance is the meeting agenda set?  I noticed that a meeting is scheduled for Nov. 29, but an agenda was not available on the Web site.  Is it likely that it is still being compiled?  How do you get on the agenda?
 
Any light you can shed on this for me would be appreciated.  I don't know if this project is going to come through or not, but I'm not sure my possible client is any better versed on CPUC procedures than I am.  I figure at least one of us should know what we're talking about.
 
Thanks!  You might give me a heads up if there's anything on one of the upcoming Wednesday calls that you'd like me to comment on.  Since I'm basically on call, I probably won't dial in unless someone gives me a reason.
 
Best,

Subject: meeting with Enron


Jeff,

It was great to talk to you today.  Thank you so much for taking the time to
hear about our latest developments.  As I said earlier, we are very
interested in talking to your folks in the Net Works group at Enron.  The
pilot we are implementing for the Enron Energy Services group is going
extremely well.  We've been on site now for about two weeks and have pretty
much completed our user training sessions.  Everyone at Enron is very
pleased with the success of the project so far.  

I think the best thing would be to schedule a meeting for sometime in
mid-October.  That way, the Pilot Program will be completely implemented and
we will have more feedback on the use of our application.  How about the
week of October 15th?  Anytime that week will work with us and, as I told
you earlier, we are in Houston very frequently.

The people who would be a part of the discussion would be Ian Sullivan (who
heads up all implementation and professional services) and myself.

If anyone would like more information about Perfect Commerce prior to the
meeting I would be more than happy to send that over.  Just let me know.

Look forward to hearing from you.

Best regards,

Cameron

Subject:	SCE-QF Update

I listed in on this afternoon's IEP call re: SCE's MOU.

According to Smutney-Jones (who was more than average mad), SCE has reneged on the ""pay 10% up front"" portion of the deal they struck with SCE.  According to IEP, SCE says that the banks, who are spooked by TURN's success in getting a 14-day temporary suspension of the CPUC-SCE settlement, is not interested in allowing SCE to pay any creditors like QFs preferentially. SCE said the 5.37 c/kWh commitment is still there, however.  IEP's was also unsuccessful in getting the effective date of 5.37 c/kWh changed in return for the loss of the 10% up front.

CCC/Jerry Bloom, who represents gas-fired QFs is seperately negotiating with SCE and may be willing to give up 10% in return for commiting to 5.37c/kwh outside of the CPUC.  (They are concerned with CPUC overturning the IEP-SCE ""deal."")

Several parties on the call, including CalEnergy, indicated they may sue SCE outside the CPUC over reneging on this deal.

Few things:

1)	No, I'm not looking for employment in the face of Enron's current financial ""challenges.""
2)	Could you forward Michael's email address to me?
3)	Are you aware of what Edison's going to be proposing at the PUC on Nov. 7th w.r.t. how it 	intends to recoup its ""undercollection"" under its settlement with the PUC.  In short, all  	DA customers, irrespective of whether they were taking from Edison at the time that Edison 	accrued the ""undercollection,"" would be ""responsible"" for paying.  Which means DA customers 	would pay twice for power--once to their ESP and now, again, to Edison.  Is this something 	that your clients care about?  We care quite a bit.

One of the big issues is whether there ought to be hearings on all of this, or whether Karl Wood ought to just be able to push rates around based on briefs only.  We feel pretty strongly that hearings are required.  One of our big concerns is that this will be the tip of the iceberg, i.e., Edison will continue on after this in an attempt to force all kinds of costs on customers.  You have a view on whether hearings are required?  More importantly do your clients have an interest in all of this, and will you be there on the 7th?

This looks like we are going to be in a long pissing match with Edison.  It would be very helpful to know what our position is with DA customers before Cal Push 1 and Cal Push 2 going forward.  I know that this is probably a pain, but it seems like that's information that we need to know.  Also, it appears that Edison is under the opinion that we were short a call option to them during the ctc recovery period.  Edison gets to keep positive ctc's while they get to recover negative ctc's from esp's.

jeff d., what does edison say to the point that they got to keep positive ctc's and are now attempting to amortize negative ctc's?

Just to be clear (since we had a bit of a different take last Friday in the meeting that Jim and Sue and I had with Mike).  Mike's take was that we'd be addressing just about everything under the sun, including why we think that hearings are necessary.  This takes a much narrower approach.

Understanding that we're really trying to get this thing done and that there's a million different ornaments one could hang on the tree (and bring the thing toppling down), I'll just throw this out for consideration.

Seems that as a first-order issue, the judge is either going to approve the settlement or cede to arguments the PUC could make regarding its exclusive ratemaking authority--that is what it is.
Assuming that the judge sides in our favor, there remains the chance that the PUC could take the Edison view and charge DA customers for the undercollection, thereby taking back what we achieved in the settlement based on the way our deals are structured with our customers.
It would help alot if PG&E took the position at the PUC that (for a variety of reasons) the PUC should NOT tack on DA customers' bills any charges designed to pay down the utilities' undercollection.
In a proceeding where Edison and PG&E are on different sides, our chances of prevailing are of course much better.
But it likely won't do much good if we have any such deal written explicitly in the settlement document (i.e., PG&E agrees to take our side at the PUC).
But if there's any way to do some sort of side deal, outside of the settlement agreement, and if PG&E were amenable, there might be some real value.

Again, I know we want to get this thing wrapped up, but thought I'd toss it out there.  We can take it or leave it.

Legislative Weekly 
September 6, 2001 
Issue 35, Volume 3 

A weekly publication from the 
California Manufacturers & Technology Association 
detailing legislative and regulatory developments in Sacramento





ELECTRICAL RESTRUCTURING 

SBX2 78 (Polanco D-Los Angeles and Sher D-Stanford).  CMTA supports this bill to allow Southern California Edison to collect $2.9 billion from customers to cover excess power costs incurred between May 2000 and January 2001.  While the debt can only be assessed against customers over 20kw in demand, provisions protecting the right to direct access and customer generation overcome our objections to the disproportionate spread of debt. The bill will be on the assembly floor this week. 

SBX2 27 (Bowen D-Marina del Rey).  This direct access bill remains a potential vehicle for reinstatement of direct access if SBX2 78 fails.  It failed to gain 2/3 votes in the Senate last June. CMTA did not support the bill, but remains willing to work with the author. 

SBX2 18 (Burton D-San Francisco).  CMTA supports this bill to create a separate revenue stream for payment of state energy revenue bonds, saving financing costs and simplifying the relationship between bonds and Department of Water Resources power contracts.  Passed out of Assembly Energy Costs and Availability. 

SBX2 85 (Burton).  CMTA opposes this bill to repeal the sunset on the 10% rate discount for small commercial and residential customers that was created by AB 1890.  It passed out of Assembly EC&A. 
  

NATURAL GAS EXIT FEES 

ABX2 23 (Pescetti R-Rancho Cordova) requires non-core customers to make long-term projections regarding their firm service gas delivery needs, and would allow utilities to impose exit fees on non-core customers that do not later desire that firm service level. 

CMTA is opposed unless exit fees are removed. CMTA supports amendments to simply require the PUC to study the state's natural gas infrastructure to determine ways in which to expand capacity and increase competition.  The bill has not yet been set for hearing in Senate Energy Utilities and Communications. 
  

ELECTRICAL GENERATION - EMINENT DOMAIN 

ABX2 35 (Vargas D-San Diego) authorizes the California Consumer Power and Conservation Financing Authority to exercise eminent domain to acquire generating facilities for 18-24 months.  Generators would be reimbursed a ""reasonable rental value"" as opposed to ""fair market value"" for facilities temporarily taken by the State.  Co-generation facilities are not exempt from the bill. 

CMTA is opposed and the bill may not move.  It is rumored that a Legislative Counsel opinion questions its constitutionality. The bill is currently in the Assembly Energy Costs and Availability Committee. 
  

ELECTRICAL GENERATION - STRICT LIABILITY 

ABX2 51 (Reyes D-Fresno) provides that a resale or wholesale operator of an electric generation facility that reduces or discontinues service for solely economic reasons shall be held strictly liable for any damages proximately caused by that reduction or discontinuance.  ""Economic reasons"" is defined as the withholding of power for financial gain. Cogeneration is exempted from the bill. 

CMTA is opposed.  According to the author's staff, the measure will not be moved. The bill is in Assembly EC&A Committee. 
  

ELECTRICITY AND NATURAL GAS - ILLEGAL BUSINESS PRACTICES 

Despite rigorous debate on the Assembly Floor, on September 4 the Assembly adopted amendments to ABX2 65 (Cardoza D-Merced) which make the bill less onerous.  As amended, the measure makes it a wobbler for any person or entity, whose principal business is the generation or sale of electricity, to exercise market power.  Market power is defined as the profitable maintenance of wholesale electricity prices above the prices that would occur in the wholesale market if that market were competitive.  The measure also allows the imposition of a fine of up to 10 percent of the violator's gross assets, upon conviction.  Felony penalties would apply to any person or entity that exercised market power during a Stage 1, 2 or 3 electrical emergency as determined by the Independent System Operator. 

The September 4 amendments limit the bill to apply only to entities whose principal business is the generation or sale of electricity that are able to exercise market power, and technically exempt qualifying facilities, co-generation, or self-generation.  The measure still includes onerous bounty-hunter provisions that authorize the Attorney General to pay a reward to any person who provides information that materially contributes to the imposition of a criminal fine.  The reward would be equal to 10% of the amount of the criminal fine collected by the AG, district attorney, or imposed by the court.  The measure likely will be taken up for a vote on the Assembly Floor sometime this week. 
  

TAX - TRIAL DE NOVO 

AB 934 (Hertzberg D-Van Nuys).  CMTA supports reforms to the property tax assessment appeal process, granting courts more power to overturn decisions that are anti-taxpayer. Assessors and counties claim that they will be manipulated into settling disputes too cheaply.  They obtained a Leg Counsel opinion declaring it to violate the California Constitution. 

The bill is in Senate Rules.  CMTA is lobbying to ensure that it is sent to Appropriations and are lobbying members of that committee as well as members whose votes will be needed on the floor.  There is speculation that it is being held in Rules for leverage for a larger deal but it is more probable that it is a tactic to delay it until Hertzberg, the author, is no longer Speaker. 
  

CORPORATE COUNSEL - PROTECTIVE ORDER/CONFIDENTIAL SETTLEMENTS 

AB 36 (Steinberg D-Sacramento), SB 11 (Escutia D-Whittier), AB 881 (Simitian D-Palo Alto).  CMTA opposes these bills to potentially expose proprietary information to the public.  SB 11 and AB 36 drive up litigation costs for defendants, leveraging higher settlements. AB 36 was ""Speakerized"" with the proviso that its substance would not go to the Governor, that SB 11 would be ""the vehicle"" and be revised into a more business friendly version.  Nevertheless, AB 36 (unchanged) has received a rule waiver allowing it to move in the Senate. 

CMTA is working on keeping the moderate Democrats in the Assembly from passing SB 11 and, if AB 36 does go to the Governor, in having them help with obtaining a veto.  CMTA is proposing AB 881 as an alternative though it is preferred that it not pass, and the trial lawyers would likely kill it.  At this point it appears that the moderates will stay with us but it appeared that way just before they caved-in in June. 
  

EDUCATION - CAREER AND TECHNICAL EDUCATION 

AB 348 (Wright D-So. Central Los Angeles).  Several ""voc-ed"" bills designed to bolster this ailing system were passed by the Legislature this year including AB 348 which introduces mechanisms to elevate the academic standing of such courses.  Unfortunately, much of the funding for the voc-ed bills was cut out of the Budget. 
  

EDUCATION - FACILITIES BOND 

AB 16 (Hertzberg D-Van Nuys/Leonard R-San Bernardino) and SB 844 (Chesbro D-Arcata).  CMTA has declared support for this legislation to place a statewide school facilities bond on the ballot in 2002. Their scope spans K-College.  A conference committee is addressing the timing for the ballot (March vs. November), the amount and the allocation between K-12 and higher ed., and the allocation system to use among schools. 
  

HOUSING 

CMTA supports two bills: AB 1284 (Lowenthal D-Long Beach) which provides property tax rewards to local jurisdictions within specified job centers (basically all of the major urban areas) which approve and build housing affordable to the local workforce.  SB 910 (Dunn D-Santa Ana) would impose sanctions on local jurisdictions which chronically fail to plan for their housing needs.  Both bills are in their second houses but are two-year projects.  Their terms will be negotiated during the interim. 
  

$3.6 BILLION WORKERS' COMPENSATION BILL ON THE GOVERNOR'S DESK 

The Senate concurred in the Assembly amendments to the workers' compensation benefits bill on September 6 .  The bill is now on its way to the Governor.  The bill, SB 71 (Burton), would cost employers $3.6 billion over 5 years with no substantive changes to help offset the increased cost.  The quick passage of the bill by the Senate ends any speculation that Senator Burton may be in a negotiating mood. 

There was some hope that some negotiation would ensue after the Governor entered the fray on Thursday, August 30 by revealing a $1.5 billion proposal that was significantly less expensive and onerous to employers.  However, the proposal caused Senator Burton and his co-author, Assemblyman Calderon, to call a hasty press conference where the governor's proposal was characterized as a slap in the face to labor.  Senator Burton predicted that a veto of SB 71 would spark a ballot initiative (that could double employers' costs).  He also thought the veto would be an invitation for injured workers to vote for former Los Angeles Mayor Dick Riordan or someone else. 

Steve Smith, Director, Department of Industrial Relations and the governor's point person on workers' compensation said, ""the governor's plan became public only after it was presented to a group of labor leaders and it was intended to stimulate discussion about how best to get a workers' compensation bill that the governor is comfortable with.""  Smith dismissed the threat of labor turning to someone else in the next election because the governor has stood with working Californians on issue after issue and he would be shocked if they were considering endorsing someone else. 

Now that the bill is on the Governor's desk, it is imperative that employers write the Governor requesting a veto.  For information on SB 71 go to the CMTA web site at <http://www.cmta.net/press/082301work_comp.shtml> 
  

UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE 

SB 40 (Alarcon D-Sylmar) would increase unemployment insurance (UI) cost by over $3 billion over four years and includes several other onerous changes for employers.  The bill is in the Assembly Appropriations Committee on the suspense file and is opposed by CMTA. 

Unlike workers' compensation, UI has only two active parties of interest, labor and employers.  CMTA believes that employers are more vulnerable to a benefit increase in UI than workers' compensation because our maximum benefit level is the second lowest of all the states.  Therefore, employer representatives from CMTA, Cal-Chamber, Cal-Tax and Newspaper Publishers Association met with the author and labor to discuss a benefit increase and reforms to help offset some costs. The coalition has put together a proposal to counter SB 40. 

CMTA does not believe that the Governor would sign two benefit bills in the same year unless they were both negotiated and agreed upon by both labor and management.  According to the latest news, the Governor asked labor to choose and labor decided on the workers' compensation bill this session.  Therefore, no further action on UI will be taken this session. 
  

STORMWATER 

SB 72's author, Senator Kuehl (D-Santa Monica), and the bill sponsor, Santa-Monica-based Heal The Bay, agreed to remove all of the controversial minimum stormwater monitoring requirements affecting industrial facilities.  Most notably, the August 21 version deletes the proposed increase in stormwater sampling frequency and language requiring inclusion of additional constituents in each sampling event.  The current version also deletes all references to group monitoring - a regulatory program designed to streamline monitoring requirements for similar industrial facilities - which was originally prohibited.  These changes will spare individual facilities from thousands of dollars in increased stormwater monitoring costs.  All opposition has been removed, and the amendments lower the state's anticipated costs substantially.  The next hurdle is the state water board's renewal of the General Industrial Stormwater Permit next year. 
  

SAFE DRINKING WATER & TOXIC ENFORCEMENT ACT 

The Safe Drinking Water and Toxic Enforcement Act (Proposition 65), SB 471 (Sher), was amended on July 5 to incorporate language developed by the Attorney General's office.  It is intended to help curb frivolous litigation, invited by lucrative bounty hunter provisions, that has overwhelmed the AG's resources.  Although advertised as a pro-business reform measure, the AG's proposal undermined the certainty of Prop. 65 settlements by allowing a district attorney, city attorney or private prosecutor to sue again for the same alleged offense.  The AG and Senator Sher have since agreed to remove that provision and make other lesser changes to avoid opposition from the business community.  The bill requires a 2/3 vote, which may not be achievable without a commitment from the AG to pursue further discussions toward more substantive reform. 
  

2002 PRELIMINARY ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY FORECAST 

Water Quality Standards - SB 469 (Alpert D-Coronado).  Held up in end of session politics, the bill advances consensus recommendations to improve regional implementation of federal Total Maximum Daily Load program.  Requires state water board to develop guidelines for regional boards on listing and de-listing water bodies and implementing TMDLs.  Would help focus state resources on legitimate water quality problems.  May move as urgency legislation in January, 2002. 

Wastewater Discharge Offset Program - SB 815 (Machado D-Linden). Two-year vehicle to address the affects of legacy sources of pollution (e.g., abandoned mines) without bankrupting the discharger community.  Would provide less costly alternatives to end-of-the pipe permit limits, such as investing in upstream cleanup projects, with greater environmental benefits. 

Environmental Justice.  Under pressure from environmental activists, CARB is pursuing an aggressive agenda that does not track legislative direction.  Staff will present draft guidelines to the Board in December.  CARB's work will serve as a model for other Cal-EPA agencies required by SB 115 (Solis, 1999) and SB 89 (Escutia, 2000) to review their programs to address environmental justice concerns. 

Toxic Injuries - SB 693 (Scott D-Altadena).  Two-year measure sponsored by trial lawyers to extend the statute of limitations for filing injury claims related to hazardous material exposures.  Anticipate an oppose position. 

Brownfields Cleanup Incentives - AB 1114 (Pescetti).  Stalled this year due to politics surrounding Senator Escutia's local agency enforcement-based program in SB 32.  AB 1114 seeks flexible, risk-based cleanup standards, innocent operator liability relief and modest financial incentives for parties seeking to voluntarily initiate cleanup and redevelopment.

Well, here's a chance to take your mind off of things.  I've got a pair of exceptional 49er tickets--lowest section in 2nd tier, right on the 50 yardline. (My girlfriend's parents season tickets. I can't use them--in fact, ain't crazy about football)  They're playing the Saints, which will be a great game.  

I'm selling them for face value, which is $50 each.  Like to be able to give them to someone in the office if possible.  If you're interested, please let me know ASAP.

With everything else going on, I apologize for raising this issue, but I'm concerned that if I don't, it may fall through the cracks.

I just realized over the weekend that within the next few weeks, I will have paid the full balance on tuition for the Fall 2001 semester in Berkeley's MBA program that I've been in since 1999.  (By the end of this semester, I will have finished 37 of the 40 units that are required to complete the program).

Naturally, I'd like to get reimbursed for the Fall semester's tuition, but I'm concerned that recent events create uncertainty at just about every level of the company.  

I know you've got a hell of alot on your plate right now, so there's no need to discuss immediately.  I simply wanted to get it on the radar screen.  Whenever you get a free minute, give me a ring and we can talk about it further. Take care, and thanks for listening.

?	The PUC's decision 1) suspending DA and 2) signaling the PUC's intent to continue to consider nullifying DA contracts signed after July 1 is full of holes.
?	We haven't detected any downside in joining with coalitions, and trying to get other coalitions, to appeal the PUC order.  
?	Sue Mara is working with the ARM coalition to appeal yesterday's order and is taking the lead generally on the effort to reverse things.
?	The appeals that we would join, and attempt others to persue on their own, would focus principally on two issues:  1) disabusing the PUC of the notion that it has the legal authority to nullify contracts retroactively, and 2) lifting the suspension on DA altogether (let me know if I've missed anything here, Sue).

Please let us know if folks have any concerns that would cause us to reconsider pursuing these challenges.

As you know Edison is being, well, Edison about just about everything at the PUC.  I think that we actually have some leverage with PG&E, however.  I've helped to broker a meeting between large customers and PG&E (Tom Botorff and Dan Richard) this Friday at 1:30 PM after DJ's meeting.  DJ and Delainey are organizing
 
The (basic) idea is to see if there is some way to strike a ""reasonable"" deal on the DA/cost allocation issues with PG&E, which could then be submitted to PUC around Edison, which seems hell bent on piling as many costs on business customers as possible.
 
At the first meeting, we want to spend a very brief amount of time determining 1) what matters to people 2) where people on the issues and 3) PG&E's willingness to deal.  The goal is to find out if there's any room for a deal.  Should not take a long time.
 
I hope you can attend, since the meeting will be significantly less productive if you're not there, and who knows, it may lead to something that permits us to go around Edison.  Likely attendees are CMTA, CLECA, the Chamber, you (hopefully), PG&E and me.  Will Mike Kahl be at DJ's meeting?

The project is a peaker plant inside Lodi's territory, with the power sold to DWR.
The deal is both price and time sensitive (no surprise there).  Needs to be on line Q3/Q4, 2002, at a price that's in line with price negotiated with DWR.
For the gas interconnect, your folks tell us that the project requires $8-$11 MM in system upgrades that will take 14-16 months to complete.
By contrast, the project could connect directly to Lodi's gas storage facility for about $2.6 MM and could be completed in about 4-6 months.
In short, PG&E's offers blows through both the time and price constraints; the Lodi option accommodates both very well.
We are very senstive to the tariff revenues you would forgo via a direct connect to Lodi and potential concerns regarding precedent over connecting directly to the storage facility.
Therefore, 1) we'd be willing to pay the local distribution tariff price, irrespective of being connected directly to the Lodi facility, 2) we'd be willing to switch over and connect with PG&E once the upgrades in the Lodi/Stockton area are done, and 3) we'd agree that the direct connection with Lodi should be viewed as a ""special case"" (and not precendent) with the goal of avoiding exacerbating California's problems with supply shortages.

Subject:	Implementation of the Suspension Direct Access -- UDCs' Plan

On Friday, November 16th, the UDCs submitted their joint plan for
implementing the suspension of direct access.  Parties have until,
Wednesday, November 28th, to comment.

The following are proposed implementation rules for which the UDCs seek
Commission approval:

1.  A  DASR can only be processed if the customer name appears on the ESP
List submitted to the UDCs on October 5, 2001.

2. In order to submit an ESP List the ESP must have a valid ESP/UDC Service
Agreement as of September 20, 2001 and , for ESPs serving small customers,
they must have in effect a valid Commission registration as of September 20,
2001.

3. For a DASR to be processed for a residential or small commercial customer
account, the ESP must be able to demonstrate that the required third party
verification took place prior to September 20, 2001.

4.  Customers should not be allowed to switch from one ESP to another after
September 20 unless the new ESP had a valid ESP- customer contract in place
on or before Sept. 20th.

5.  Seamless moves within a UDC's service territory will be allowed.

6. For customers on bundled service as of September 20, 2001 (but still
under a DA contract), the UDCs are proposing not to allow such customers to
process DASRs even if their names are on the October 5 list.


7.  If all  accounts of one ESP transferred to another as a result of a
merger, then the situation is okay because no new DASR would be required;
requests for one customer to switch from one ESP to another only allowed if
the new ESP-customer relationship had a contract prior to Sept. 20, 2001.

8. Changes in customer identity allowed on  case by case basis (e.g., if a
customer changes its type of business it would not be allowed).

9. One  customer can not transfer or assign its direct access service rights
to another.

10.  Processing of DASRs submitted for customers who attempt to opt into a
community aggregation program after the suspension date should not be
allowed.

In addition to the above, the UDCs proposed three additional options for
implementing the suspension.

1.  The Commission should impose a DASR cut-off date (received and
accepted).

2.  If the Commission does not impose a strict DASR cut off, it should
require that any ESP which wishes to have a DASR processed after the cut off
to submit their account specific DASR information and ESP contract to the
Commission along with an explanation of why the customer is eligible to
receive DA.  The UDC will not process the DASR until it receives an okay
from the Commission.

3.  The ESP certifies through an affidavit that a particular DASR was
associated with a contract in existence on September 20, 2001 (the UDCs set
forth a proposed affidavit.)

Hi Jeff,

Hope you are doing well. Got your email from Scott. I'm hoping you can
do me a favor.  We are doing a  research project for a client and are
trying to identify key technical management at a variety of companies,
including Enron.

Specifically, we are looking for names and addresses of the following:

CIO/CTO
VP, Directors and/or Sr. Managers responsible for the company's
network.  They'll typically have titles like VP of Network Operations
and Senior Network Architect.

Any chance you can get me this info for Enron? I'd be forever in your
debt.

thanks,

 kent

Subject: Order Instituting Rulemaking to Establish Policies and Cost
Recovery Mechanisms for Generation Procurement


On October 29, 2001, the commission issues an order instituting a rulemaking
to establish ratemaking mechanisms to enable SCE, PG&E and SDG&E to resume
purchasing electric energy, capacity ,ancillary services and related hedging
instrument to full their obligation to serve their customers once DWR's
authority to purchase on their behalf ends (December 31, 2001). At that
point, the UDCs, not DWR, will have to pick up anything not covered by
retained generation and the DWR contracts.  The Commission will also address
proposals on how renewable resources should be included in the mix of
generation serving the state. The OIR will have a significant impact on
procurement practices in the state on a going forward basis.    The ruling
states that if you are interested in being on the service list for this
proceeding, a letter must be sent to the docket office stating that fact
within 15 days (by next Monday). 

Bottom line is do you want me to continue to monitor (and perhaps get
active) in this proceeding.  Please let me know by the end of the week so
that I can send in the required letter.

Dear Victor and David: 

Please review the CPUC attachments provided by CLECA's Dr. Barbara Barkovich. The CPUC is aggressively following up on Direct Access contracts and DASR's. Please let us know where you are in responding to the CPUC Direct Access Verification process as it relates to Hanson Permanente's contract with Enron, as follows:

1. Have you been contacted by the CPUC or PG&E related to the Direct Access verification process? 
2. What information have you provided to the CPUC and to any other requesting party? 

We look forward to hearing from you ASAP on answers to these questions.  We would also appreciate copies of any correspondence that you have had with anyone on the DASR and Direct Access Contract. 

The DASR process was handled very poorly by Enron in September, and those errors delayed Hanson Permanente's opportunity to participate in Direct Access until November. We are awaiting Enron's remedy to compensate Hanson for the added power cost incurred during October 2001.

Please call me if you have any questions. 

Sincerely, 

Earl

A few months ago, I sent a note to the North American Government Affairs gr=

Attached is a ruling issued yesterday by Commissioner Wood directing that E=

:

1.     By December 3, 2001, any party who believes that it has a direct acc=
ess contract or agreement potentially affected by an order to suspend direc=
t access as of July 1, 2001 or a date earlier than September 20, 2001, shal=
l submit a true and correct copy of each of the actual contracts or agreeme=
nts along with any arguments as to the impact of such an order.  A failure =
to submit this information for the Commission's consideration will be consi=
dered a waiver of the arguments related to claims involving the contracts a=
nd agreements.  Initially, the true and correct copy of each of the actual =
contracts or agreements shall be filed under seal with the Commission's Doc=
ket Office and served on Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) Robert Barnett.<?xm=
l:namespace prefix =3D o ns =3D ""urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office"" /=

2.     Office of Ratepayer Advocates shall work with the parties who have e=
xecuted direct access contracts or agreements to develop a proposed protect=
ive order and nondisclosure agreement for Commission staff, which shall be =
submitted to ALJ Barnett by December 3. =20

3.     The electric service providers and customers who are parties shall w=
ork with other parties and shall jointly submit a proposed protective order=
 and nondisclosure agreement that will cover parties other than Commission =
staff by December 11, 2001.=20

4.     Parties' supplemental comments to the comments they filed in respons=
e to the October 23rd Assigned Commissioner Ruling shall be submitted by Ja=
nuary 4, 2002.


As a preliminary matter, of course, AReM and WPTF do not, in their own name=
s, have direct access contracts.  However, certain members of AReM and WPTF=
 are direct parties to the proceeding and need to consider what course they=
 wish to take.  The group also needs to consider if they wish to fight this=
 Order on Constitutional or procedural grounds.  I will be considering our =
options and get back to you with more detail.  However, as a very prelimina=
ry analysis, it is evident that the Commission does not have jurisdiction o=
ver either ESPs or the customers they serve.  The request is also particula=
rly outrageous because of the statements that, ""A failure to submit this in=
formation for the Commission's consideration will be considered a waiver of=
 the arguments related to the claims involving the contracts and agreements=
"" and ""Parties to this proceeding may have access to these contracts and ag=
reements after the appropriate protective order and nondisclosure agreement=
s are in effect.""  The former is a likely denial of due process and the lat=
ter exposes proprietary contracts and pricing information to ESP competitor=
s and exposes sensitive pricing information to competitors of energy-depend=
ent customers. =20
=20
Your thoughts would be appreciated.  My initial reaction  is that this is t=
ime for ESPs and customer groups, such as CMTA, ABAG, CLECA, CIU, EPUC, SPU=
RR, etc., to band together and fight this at multiple levels, from the Gove=

Here's our assessment of Wright's performance in California.

On the plus side:
He is generally pro-business, and has opposed bills that threaten economic growth, e.g., he opposed the windfall profits, and related, bills.
He sided with the California Assembly Republicans to craft an alternative to the ""MOU"" for Edison that included direct access as a core feature of any MOU.
His decision to work with the Republicans helped move the political ""center of gravity""--albeit marginally--more favorably toward direct access in California.

On the negative side: 
In each and every case that Rod has had to make a choice between the market, customers and competition on the one hand, and the utility on the other, he has never waivered in his decision--he always put the utility first.
Here are three examples (and there are more):  
1) 	During this extraordinary session, he sponsored a bill that would have explicitly created a ""stranded cost charge"" for utilities. 	Yet by most accounts, Californians have already paid off the utilties' stranded costs.  How many times must Californians pay? 	We worked with consumer and business 	groups to oppose the bill.
2)	In the ""alternative MOU"" that Rod worked on with Republicans, the Replicans told us that Rod insisted on suspending Direct 	Access until January 1, 2003--a demand that most believe originated with Edison.
3)	Rod sponsored a bill two years ago that would prevent any market participant other than the utilities to provide metering and 	billing services.  Today, this issue is less important to us, but it was very important to us at the time, and Rod remained 	unswervingly in the utilities' camp, despite our efforts.

Hope this helps.  If you need any other information, just let me know.

*********************************************************************************************************************************

Hi Marcie:

	Congratulations again on your new role at Anaheim.  Elena tells me that you're having a great time.

	Thanks for taking the time to talk a little bit about the strategic alliances Enron is forming with public power.	We're excited about our alliance model because it offers a true win-win for municipal power companies and their customers.  I've attached a power point presentation that provides an overview of the program.  

	In sum, the initiative offers public power systems leading edge competitive retail energy and risk management products and services for their commercial and industrial electric customers, using their own brand name.  Since EES retains and manages all price and product related risks, our alliance partners are freed up to offer their customers valuable and sought after products and services with no additional risk.

Here are some of the program's highlights:

Enabling our alliance partners to provide their customers with products and services that are superior to what competitive suppliers are offering, reaffirming the value of public power and a strong customer focus.

Our alliance partners maintain exclusive control over customer relationships and continue to market power under their own name. 

Our market-tested and accepted products and services allow your customers to better manage costs, reduce operational and financial risks and focus on their core business activities

Our alliance partners do not take on any price risk related to these products.

Products and services customization further enable our alliance partners to spur economic development and maintain customer retention.

Innovative financial solutions that allow companies to upgrade industrial facilities and energy infrastructure, including energy consuming equipment and demand-side management programs, without diverting capital from their core businesses. 

	Thanks again for taking the time to talk yesterday.  If you have any questions, give me a call at 415.782.7822, and I'll call you in the next few days about arranging a time that we can meet with you in beautiful Southern California.

All the best,
Jeff",,453,0

Hi Jeff:

I'm not sure if hiring is an issue these days for you, but I wanted to let
you know that Jim Bushnell and I will be again teaching a course at
Berkeley this spring called ""Energy Market Strategies and Policies.""  The
course is cross-listed between the Haas School of Business and the Energy
& Resources Group (ERG) at UC Berkeley.

The course is currently limited to 42 students, but it is already
over-subscribed, so we are trying to move it to a larger classroom. We'll
have mostly MBA students from Haas, but also about a dozen masters
students from ERG. There are also usually at least a few PhD students.
The students in the class are were very smart -- many of them
already have experience in the energy industries -- and we believe the
course puts them in a position to immediately contribute to any
energy-related organization that they would join.  You can see a copy of
last year's course syllabus at
 http://www.haas.berkeley.edu/~borenste/EnergyMarketsSyllabus.pdf

Many of these students are interested in either summer or permanent
employment starting as early as May.  If you have openings that you would
like to advertise to these students, please let me know.  We will be
setting up a webpage with job announcements in energy-related
organizations.  If you send me a job description (or the URL for it), I
can add it to the webpage.

Talk to you soon,
Severin

The primary reasons cited for why rehearing should be granted are as follows: 
The Decision violates procedural due process guarantees. 
The failure to hold hearings violates Public Utilities Code section 1708.5(f). 
The Commission's reliance on material outside the record violates due process. 
The Decision violates the Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution. 
The threatened retroactivity is contrary to law and in excess of the Commission's authority. 
The Commission acted contrary to law and in excess of its authority.

I have had an opportunity to talk to most of you regarding the attached 
proposal.  I apologize I ran out of time yesterday and didn't catch
everyone.

NWE would like to propose a slightly different take on our AREM filing
having had a chance to think more about it.  I wanted to run it by everyone
to get your thoughts before submitting a redline.  If you feel this warrants
a conference call I will gladly set one up for today.  Time is of the
essence and would appreciate your feedback as soon as possible.  If we all
agree, I would like to get the re-write with everyone's blessing to Dan by
tomorrow at 8:00 am. or sooner.

Proposal Benefits

	1.	We look more reasonable and agree to much of what UDCs are
proposing.
	2.	Accommodates most, if not all, of ESP and customer concerns.
	3.	Strong argument for avoiding any contract review.    Our
verification proposal could backfire; PUC could accept our approach, but add
details which goes toward ESPs submitting contracts to the PUC for review
and validation

All,
I spoke with the customer, Mike Benson. He is not angry, but he would like his accounts returned to bundled service. He understands that we are implementing a large contract with SBC Corp Real Estate, and that it is possible more of his accounts are inadvertantly on the list.  He knows to contact me directly with future issues. I submitted the deal sheet to de-DASR the 2 accounts he identified to Samantha Fite a few moments ago.
I have also notified the SBC contracts manager of the situation.
Let me know if there are any questions or concerns.

Subject:	Pac Tel - CPUC Customer Switch Complaint

I received a call late today from the CPUC (Joyce @ 415-703-2199).  Someone from Pac Tel called and said that his service was switched without authorization - Mike Benson with Payphone group @707-253-8892 or 707-292-1766.

Lamar -- who is the client rep for Pac Tel?  Can they get into Pac Tel and try and find out if we have done something inappropriate?  We need to call this guy back by Monday EOB.  Please let Jeff Dasovich know so he can call Joyce back - I'll be out on vacation next week.

JoAnn,

If the employee is attending class at this present time and waiting for grades to be received in December, then have employee submit grades to HR.  With the recent developments with Enron, we will have to get tuitions approved by Executive HR - VP.

Should you have further questions, please let me know.

As you know, I'm finishing up my MBA at Berkelely (I'll have but one class left to take next semester!).  Finals/projects, etc. are all done/due, etc. next week, so as you can imagine it's very crazy.
In addition, I (we) had to put the sweetest dog in the world to sleep this week, and the Enron thing's been nothing compared to that.
(I'd ask, ""what next?"", but I'm afraid to ask.....)
However, none of this constitutes an excuse for not getting back to you, so I apologize.
OK, back to Enron.
It's a mess (surprise).
I'm still with the company--not sure for how long, however.  At least through the end of the year, it appears.
Sue and Joseph have left.  If you'd like their contact information, I'd be happy to provide it.
We're trying to transfer our DA contracts to other ESPs, but the utilities, Carl Wood and some others want to make it difficult, if not impossible.
Though difficult as it may seem to believe, I'm actually doing OK (engaging in lots of zen buddist stuff) and I do promise to give each of you a ring to catch up very soon.
This week's a little tough just because with school and ""the mess,"" I'm a tad preoccupied.

Good news!  Wallace decided last night that we don't have to do a write-up for project after all.  All we have to do is turn in the presentation and the spreadsheet.  I've written her an email, telling her that we followed directions closely on the presentation (i.e., very simply, no jargon, spreadsheets, lots of technical crap, etc.) and wanted to make sure that that would acceptably when we turn it in, or  if she expected some ""beefing up.""

I plant to spend a little time with my slides and the spreadsheet (though not much!), just to make a bit better.  I'll let you know how she responds.

Great job by all.

Subject: Enron's plans on 2 projects


Jeff and Stan:

I lead the group responsible for assuring safe, reliable and timely
generation electric interconnections with PG&E's D and T systems. I work
closely with Rod Boschee's group that handles gas gen interconnections.

I just wanted to check in with Enron to see if the company was still
planning to go ahead with the Los Banos project and the Lodi project. It's
important we know Enron's plans to assure we conduct the most accurate
transmission planning studies possible given the number of projects in the
application process, notably at Los Banos. While we have sufficient funds to
continue the pending electric study at present, we are unsure of Enron's
desires. 

As for gas interconnection issues, given the discussions about the Lodi
project extension, it would be useful to know Enron's intent with that
project also.

Thanks,

However, if Scott wanted to go and report back, then a) he gets information which likely doesn't hurt their business and b) the ""Estate"" doesn't incur the cost of Alan traveling to Sacramento to a meeting that likely won't have a huge amount of value.  But if Scott ain't interested, he ain't interested.  That's my take.

Jeff,
Thanks for this and all of the prior updates.  Thanks als for the calls last week, or was it the week prior.  The last couple of weeks have been brutal.  Hopefully things get better from here.

I have been leaving the day to day management of the ees/iso situation in the capable hands of steve hall and jeff richter.  So far so good, although I hope that the ees sales team can get a deal done soon.

I'm taking the next couple of days off.  I'll call you towards the end of the week t catch up.  Sorry I've been so hard to reach.

I hope that you are hanging in there.

Subject:	Colorful Dissent from Two PUC Commissioners Opposed to Suspending DA

Commissioners Henry M. Duque and Richard A. Bilas, dissenting:

One could say that this order is consistent with the Administration's present third world country mentality. We are punishing the very consumers and providers who made a commitment to ensuring electric restructuring did work by adding a demand retail component to cure the dysfunctions in the wholesale market.

We are not convinced that the Department of Water Resources (DWR) bond ratings depend on killing direct access.  This notion is a scare tactic and a smoke screen. Direct access comprises such a small percentage of overall demand that it cannot reasonably be seen to be a threat to the sale of the bonds. Direct Access should be seen as a benefit to DWR.  It would decrease the amount of the utilities net short obligations and relieve DWR from its power purchasing responsibilities sooner. 

Something else is going on here. We think that the DWR does not want direct access because if the public is presented with alternatives, it will make DWR's purchasing mistakes abundantly clear. The Commission should be holding hearings to test the assertions being made by DWR, Finance and the Treasurer.  Instead, the Commission is making an ill informed, panicked decision to act now and study the repercussions later. 

	DWR and the bonds should not be threatened by direct access if DWR is making prudent energy purchases. Only if DWR's contracts are too expensive, relative to market, will customers seek shelter in lower direct access prices. Indeed, retaining direct access as a way to send price signals to consumers may be the only way to place pressure on DWR to make more prudent purchases. This is a very important consideration since AB 1X prevents us from engaging in any prudency review of the DWR costs to be passed through to ratepayers in order to repay the bonds. If there is no yardstick, how can anyone measure DWR performance? The answer is, one can't, unless SB 18xx is signed into law.  

	We think that additional review of these issues, before suspending direct access, would have produced a more sound decision in the long run. 

For these reasons we must respectfully dissent.

We are not convinced that the Department of Water Resources (DWR) bond ratings depend on killing direct access.  This notion is a scare tactic and a smoke screen. Direct access comprises such a small percentage of overall demand that it cannot reasonably be seen to be a threat to the sale of the bonds. Direct Access should be seen as a benefit to DWR.  It would decrease the amount of the utilities net short obligations and relieve DWR from its power purchasing responsibilities sooner. 

Something else is going on here. We think that the DWR does not want direct access because if the public is presented with alternatives, it will make DWR's purchasing mistakes abundantly clear. The Commission should be holding hearings to test the assertions being made by DWR, Finance and the Treasurer.  Instead, the Commission is making an ill informed, panicked decision to act now and study the repercussions later. 

	DWR and the bonds should not be threatened by direct access if DWR is making prudent energy purchases. Only if DWR's contracts are too expensive, relative to market, will customers seek shelter in lower direct access prices. Indeed, retaining direct access as a way to send price signals to consumers may be the only way to place pressure on DWR to make more prudent purchases. This is a very important consideration since AB 1X prevents us from engaging in any prudency review of the DWR costs to be passed through to ratepayers in order to repay the bonds. If there is no yardstick, how can anyone measure DWR performance? The answer is, one can't, unless SB 18xx is signed into law.  

	We think that additional review of these issues, before suspending direct access, would have produced a more sound decision in the long run. 

For these reasons we must respectfully dissent.

Despite the personal pleasure that I would derive from seeing Glynn and Richard strike out big time, it's not worth the price to ratepayers of letting these pirates (yes, pirates!) rip off so many valuable assets that should stay under PUC regulation for the benefit of consumers.

FERC To Examine Alleged Market Manipulation By Calif ISO=20
Updated: Friday, September 21, 2001 04:53 PM ET By Jason Leopold Of DOW JON=
ES NEWSWIRES=20
LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--Federal energy regulators may investigate whether =
the operator of California's wholesale electricity market has been manipula=
ting its power-purchasing practices to reduce the costs of power the state =
purchased under long-term contracts, according to documents obtained Friday=
 by Dow Jones Newswires Friday.=20
At issue is whether the California Independent System Operator has violated=
 its own market rules by purchasing expensive power secured by the state un=
der contracts rather than cheaper power available in the spot market. The s=
tate's need to sell off surplus power secured under those contracts has pro=
ven embarrassing for Gov. Gray Davis, who signed $43 billion in deals to he=
ad off a summer of spiking prices and blackouts that never materialized.=20
The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission will hold a meeting in California =
Monday to address generators' complaints. The energy companies say that the=
 California ISO's purchasing decisions are difficult to comprehend and out =
of line with the market, according to a letter sent by Andrea Wolfman, lead=
 FERC counsel for market oversight and enforcement.=20
The letter was sent to the ISO, the California Department of Water Resource=
s - which has been buying power in lieu of the state's struggling utilities=
 since mid-January - and several generators, all of which were to attend th=
e meeting.=20
""Recently we have become concerned that the scheduling and dispatch procedu=
res of the California ISO, as they have had to change in the last nine mont=
hs, are not well understood or are not well suited to the current market st=
ructure,"" Wolfman said in her letter. ""The purpose of the meeting is to dev=
elop agreement between the ISO and those that participate in the scheduling=
 and dispatch (generators, utilities, CDWR) on appropriate practices and pr=
ocedures.""=20
ISO Procedures Need Explaining -FERC=20
The ISO's main responsibility is keeping power supply and demand in balance=
 on the state's electrical grid. As part of that job, the ISO determines wh=
ich power plants to call into service and which suppliers to buy power from=
.=20
If the ISO can't explain how it makes its decisions, FERC may conduct an au=
dit of the organization and investigate the possibility it has manipulated =
the market, Wolfman's office said.=20
""As discussed, FERC may schedule a technical conference and operational aud=
it of CAISO,"" a second letter from FERC's market oversight and enforcement =
division states. ""This unprecedented examination of CAISO operations could =
lead to the belief that complaints by generators of market manipulation and=
 other practices by the ISO should be investigated.""=20
The ISO's operating rules generally call for it to purchase the cheapest po=
wer first.=20
""The information that (generators) have provided all leads to a theory that=
 the CAISO is manipulating the market in order to purchase surplus DWR powe=
r at high prices and protect Gov. Davis from political embarrassment,"" the =
second letter says.=20
The ISO has said only that the market isn't operating as intended, and decl=
ined to answer other questions about the allegations or discuss Monday's me=
eting.=20

nexpensive power in the ISO's spot market only to find weeks later that the=
 price was much higher. That's because, according to the allegations, the I=
SO is letting DWR supply expensive power into the market as ""out-of-market""=
 purchases that aren't averaged into the real-time prices that ISO market p=
articipants see.=20
DWR continues to buy out-of-market power regularly at the ISO's request, DW=
R operations chief Pete Garris has said, but those purchases are being made=
 in the spot market and are never being satisfied by power from DWR's long-=
term contracts.=20
The out-of-market purchases appear to be expensive, however. According to t=
he ISO's August market report, the average out-of-market price for peak hou=
rs was $55.90 a megawatt-hour, compared with $26.49/MWh on the ISO computer=
ized market. Brokered prices of western electricity have been lower than th=
e out-of-market prices for months.=20
None of the companies mentioned was willing to comment on the record.=20
The meeting is scheduled to be held at the ISO's headquarters in Folsom, Ca=
lif., and representatives from power producers, utilities and the state are=
 expected to attend. FERC will serve as facilitator, Wolfman said. The meet=
ing isn't open to the public.=20
The meeting will begin with a presentation by the ISO on its practices and =
operational procedures, followed by adjustments that may be needed to impro=
ve the market.=20
""The objective is to develop a written set of procedures that is agreed to =
by all the market participants and that is consistent with good utility pra=
ctices,"" Wolfman said in the letter.=20

A) I didn't pick the time.  B) I talked to Sue on Friday and she will be out of Church at 10 AM PDT and on the call shortly thereafter. Sue seemed more concerned about having a call at all then on the time.  If she expressed a view that the time was set up so that she couldn't be on the call, I'd like to discuss, since that didn't factor in at all.

As you know, having gone through Sandi, I'm extremely sensitive to inter-group relations.  If you feel there are issues that we should discuss, I'd really like to do it.  I react very strongly to any view that I am intentionally doing anything to get in Sue's---or others---way.  From my perspective, I feel strongly that I haven't behaved that way, and don't in any way intend to.  I simply have no desire to ""compete"" with colleagues, Sue in particular.  There aren't enough people to do all the work, and there's plenty of tasks, recognition, blame, etc. to go around.

These are extremely challenging times and we won't get anywhere unless it's truly a team effort.  I know that the SF office has a history of challenges with respect to California leadership. I have no interest in returning to the very un-teamlike atmosphere that existed previously, particularly since the atmosphere has changed so positively in the past few months.  For a variety of reasons, I have been asked to take on alot of tasks over the past year. I've tried very hard to perform well, while at the same time working hard with Paul and Sue to advance a significantly more healthy, inclusive, open and collegial working environment in California and the West.  

I care alot of course about your perceptions, and if you have the preception that relations in the office is becoming an issue, I'd like to confront it head on.  And if Sue is expressing any concerns about how things are going generally---which she expresses to me from time to time---I'd like to sit down with you and Sue to discuss, if you think that would be useful.

Forgive the lengthy note, but having just gotten through the experience with Sandi, I'm not anxious to repeat, in any shape or form.

Talk to you at noon your time.

Subject: PICKS OF THE WEEK - WEEK 1


Welcome back all of you veteran pickers!  I'd like to introduce our three
new rookies:

The Deitrick's - Val and Scott - from napa
Andy Bledsoe - from Napa
Kent Deverell - from San Francisco

Good luck to all!!

Steve McCarthy is not in the pool this year (we'll miss his bazaar picks)
and we aren't sure if Carlton is still in.  If he is, we'll have a total of
27; if not it'll be 26.  We'll send out a completed report of the projected
payouts before the first week of the season starts.

Attached are two Excel files.  The first one just has the pick sheet for
week #1


One easy way to submit the weekly picks is to:
1)	Click on this sheet and open it in Excel
2)	Fill in the information at the top
3)	Make your weekly picks by putting numbers in the cell with the line under
it by the team you want to pick.  (This will also give you a check figure at
the bottom to be sure you have gotten, at least,  the correct total - not
necessarily the WINNING numbers, however!)
4)	Save and close the file
5)	Use ""FORWARD"" to get the e-mail back to me at eldon@direcpc.com
6)	If you use ""REPLY"" the attachment does not get sent

It really makes a huge difference in the amount of time it takes to do the
statistical work if you use this form so we really appreciate getting your
picks this way.

Here is an Excel workbook that contains a tab for every week - so all 17
weeks are here plus a sample.  However, all you need to send back is the
sheet for the current week.  Just to make it easier, (or in case you've
misplaced the attachment) we'll send out, via e-mail, each upcoming week's
pick sheet in time for you to make your selections.   If you have any
questions about Excel please give me a call at (707) 255-4813 or call Nancy
at (707) 251-4870.

ORANGE COUNTY REGISTER EDITORIAL: DAVIS HURTING STATE
     In an editorial, the Orange County Register blasts Gov. Gray 
Davis and his board picks for the California PUC, which, the 
paper asserts, have nullified the only good to come out of 
California's energy deregulation - consumer choice. With 
commentary from Lance Izumi, an electricity policy analyst at the 
Pacific Research Institute, the Register says a PUC policy that 
requires customers to buy power from their local utility company 
is forcing ratepayers to fund Davis's overpriced energy 
purchases.
     The negative impact on California businesses, some already 
in a slump, could force the state's economy into a recession and 
discourage businesses from relocating there, the editorial said. 
It's reminiscent of the 1990's when government policy caused an 
economic bust and state unemployment shot to 10% (Orange County

Attached for your review and comment is a draft application for rehearing of the Commission's Thursday Decision 01-09-060 suspending the right of direct access.  Although we have prevailed (at least for now) on the issue of retroactivity, the decision still violates various provisions of state and federal law.  If any party wishes to preserve the right to legally challenge this decision, it must file an application for rehearing within ten days.  The attached draft is tentatively dated September 28, meaning that it would be filed next Friday.
 
The primary reasons cited for why rehearing should be granted are as follows: 


The Decision violates procedural due process guarantees.

The failure to hold hearings violates Public Utilities Code section 1708.5(f).

 The Commission's reliance on material outside the record violates due process.

 The Decision violates the Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution.

 The threatened retroactivity is contrary to law and in excess of the Commission's authority.

 The Commission acted contrary to law and in excess of its authority.  

 The Decision's purported findings are not supported.

The Commission has impermissibly converted a ratemaking proceeding into a quasi-legislative proceeding.

Although WPTF members have not had an opportunity to consider whether they wish to support such a filing, WPTF is included as a named party in the attached because of the fact that AReM and WPTF have jointly made numerous other filings in this proceeding.  WPTF members will need to determine if they wish to support this effort.
 
I look forward to seeing your comments.  Thanks, and have a gtood weekend!

State fights 6,000 firms' energy deals 
Discount power contracts deemed unfair to consumers","Bernadette Tansey, Chronicle Staff Writer <mailto:btansey@sfchronicle.com>
Sunday, September 2, 2001 
?2001 San Francisco Chronicle </chronicle/info/copyright> 
URL: <http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2001/09/02/MN155174.DTL>
Thousands of California businesses may reap cost breaks on electricity while other utility customers live with record rate hikes if the state lets stand a spurt of last-minute contracts with private power suppliers. 
More than 6,000 firms, including big retail chains and industrial plants, signed discounted power contracts in July and August as market prices dropped. 
State officials are incensed, saying the private ""direct access"" contracts with electricity providers could shift the burden for millions of dollars in state power purchases onto households and small businesses. 
State Treasurer Phil Angelides said the same companies that benefited as the state depleted its budget surplus to keep the lights on now want to escape paying their share of the billions spent to ensure power supplies for California. 
""I think it's wrong and it's immoral,"" Angelides said. 
State officials argue that the summer contracts can still be canceled retroactively because California businesses were on notice that their option to shop around for better deals on electricity was about to be suspended by the state Public Utilities Commission. The PUC is set to consider the retroactive ban Thursday. But energy firms say the summer deals were perfectly legal because the PUC had not yet taken action and made a series of draft decisions that put off the effective date of the direct access ban until as late as yesterday. 
""The drafts were not consistent,"" said Tracy Fairchild, a spokeswoman for Alliance for Retail Energy Markets, a consortium of generators and energy suppliers. ""Which one were we supposed to take seriously?"" 
The energy trade group is threatening to sue to protect the summer contracts. Angelides fears that a prolonged court fight could block a $12.5 billion state bond sale to reimburse the treasury for California's emergency power purchases. 
The burgeoning conflict is part of a continuing fight by energy firms and some of their business customers to preserve direct access -- a core provision of the state's 1996 deregulation law. 
Deregulation supporters predicted energy consumers would enjoy lower prices if private generators were allowed to compete with the utilities as power suppliers. But the direct access program was thrown into disarray last year when wholesale electricity prices skyrocketed and the state stepped in to buy power. 
To make sure the state's outlay would be paid back by all ratepayers, the Legislature in January directed the PUC to suspend direct access. By that time, 
most direct access customers were fleeing back to the utilities to benefit from a rate cap that protected them from the soaring market power prices. 
The PUC postponed action on the direct access ban while some legislators were sponsoring bills that would have allowed the program to continue under certain conditions. 
But by July, market prices had come down, and energy providers like Enron Energy Services, AES New Energy and Strategic Energy were again offering direct access contracts. 
Businesses were looking for relief from the record rate hikes imposed on utility customers in June, said Phoenix energy consultant Gina Coleman. Coleman said she helped five retail chains with ""a significant number"" of stores in California negotiate contracts with Strategic Energy this summer. 
""Business is business, and if you can get a better price for something, you should,"" said Coleman, who declined to name her clients. She said the lower costs will help the stores keep doing business in California and hold their prices down. 
Daniel Douglass, an attorney for the Alliance for Retail Energy Markets, said any attempt by the state to cancel contracts retroactively would violate the constitutional law. He said energy firms have purchased power to serve their customers under the contracts and would suffer losses if they were canceled. 
Angelides said the same firms that ran to the state for protection when their market contracts became too expensive now want to take advantage of lower power prices he attributes to the stabilizing effect of the state's long- term power contracts. 
""You can't take advantage of the state's stabilizing the rates, then say, 'Thank you very much,' and stick everyone else with the bill,"" Angelides said. 
State officials have not tallied the total number of customers who signed up in July and August, nor have they estimated the revenue loss that would have to be covered by remaining utility ratepayers. 
Figures compiled by the PUC show that commercial and industrial firms signed more than 6,000 new direct access contracts in July alone. A rough calculation suggests that, as a result, the firms might contribute as much as $64 million less annually to the repayment of state costs. 
The loss might not be significant enough to risk a court fight that would delay the bond sale, state officials said. 
Bu Angelides said the same power firms that helped create the energy crisis by charging exorbitant rates are now threatening a bond issue desperately needed to restore funds needed for education, health care and children's services. 
""What they're talking about doing,"" he said, ""is holding us hostage until they get what they want.""

Latest word is that Assembly, Senate and Administration staff have been locked in a room with orders not to emerge until they've struck a deal on the Edison MOU.  

Word on DA is not good.  Thus far it appears that the PUC ""study"" outlined in the letter from Burton & Co. to Lynch is as far as the Senate wants to go at this time, but folks continue to push.  Seems to be a possibility that, if the Legislature does reconvene, there may be a push by ""green Senators"" to pass a ""green only"" DA bill.

In addition, Lynch is setting the stage to have the PUC reject the rate agreement between DWR and the PUC on Tuesday.  This despite the Governor calling to vigorously lobby each of the commissioners.  Despite the strong arm tactics, it appears that Brown may be the only aye vote at this point.

The idea is that, if the PUC votes down the rate agreement, the only thing Davis will have left is 18XX.  

We'll report back with news as we get it.

Hello Jeff,

This would be a project that we, my guys and I would take on, not just a side job.  I propose we do the job on a T& M basis, which is essentially all I do anymore.

The following are my labor rates for my guys and myself, I don't do cash work as it leaves me and my employees vulnerable, should some accident occur.

J. Docker  $45.00/hr.
Paul $30.00/hr.
Dyton $30.00/hr.
Diaz $27.00/hr.

I tack 15% on top of labor and materials, when presenting an invoice. I request payment for ongoing projects on a bi-weekly basis or upon completion of the work.

If this meets with your approval, let me know so we can get together this weekend and go over your plan. As mentioned could probably start this project in about two weeks, and if its not to elaborate a plan could probably complete in about two weeks.

Subject:	Extensions of CA Deals

CONFIDENTIAL ATTORNEY CLIENT COMMUNICATION

I'd like to get some thoughts on this issue and hopefully build a consensus pretty quickly.

We are in the process of extending the term of some of our existing CA deals that we executed on the Master in June.  Understanding that ""new"" deals struck after 9/20 are, and extensions of existing deals may be, at risk, it seems to me we have three basic options in order to effect this extension, and I want to make sure we evaluate and choose the one that minimizes the risk that the extension is invalidated.  Note that DASR's have been submitted for the subject accounts under the original Transactions.  

The 3 choices I see are:

1.  .Amend and Restate the existing Transaction Confirmation to add the extension and new price for the extension.  In this case, the extension would be wrapped up on one document that is signed after 9/20 but effective in June.
2.  Simply amend the existing Transaction to add extended term and price.  This would be a separate document.
3.  Execute a whole new Transaction for the extended term, which would be effective when signed but the services and price under which would not start until after the expiration of the existing Transaction.  The existing Transaction would stay in tact as written.

It seems to me that choice number 3 is the safest overall.  The amended and restated route has appeal because the whole transaction is dated back to June.  However, if a regulator were to peel it back, the conclusion could be that the deal was struck after Sept 20 and therefore the whole transaction was invalid, including the original structure.  I think that choice 2, though creating a separate document for the extension, could fall into the same trap.  In that sense, choice 3 seems safest because arguably the original transaction is not at risk.  If the extension is invalidated, that determination would likely not claw back to the original deal.

The commercial teams want to close these extensions in Q3 so they are moving fast.  Please let me know your thoughts asap.  If we need to have a quick call, I can set something up.  Thanks.  MDS",36,554

Based on our call, I contacted Perfect Commerce.  The two folks from
their shop that will be in Houston are:

Ian Sullivan

Cameron Sellers
VP, Business Development

They'd like to meet sometime during the week of October 15th. Let me
know if that works for you and Brad.  Or if you'd like to contact them
directly, just let me know and I'll get you their numbers/emails.

I ran across Perfect when I was doing an MBA project-we were required
to find a company that we could consult to on e-commerce strategy.

I've since found out that Perfect's doing a pilot with EES-acting as
the e-procurment platform for products tied to EES' outsourcing deals.
From what I hear it's going well, and EES is enthusiastic.

The technology is very interesting:  soup to nuts e-procurement platform
developed by Paul Milgrom (global auction guru and economist at
Stanford).  Glad you guys can meet with them.  I think it's definitely
worth the time-the technology may fit very well with Networks.

Faced with horrible polling, an unwilling legislature, an uncooperative California PUC, and a wily leader of the state Senate (Burton), Davis is now considering delaying any action to call back the legislature.
Rumors of a delay come despite Davis' statements that he would call them back next week.
We received the information about a likely delay from an Edison SVP who's working with administration staff to come up with a deal that the legislature can finally swallow.
It's Edison's view that the earliest Davis would now call the legislature back is end of next week, with early the following week being most likely.
At this point, the chance remains that Davis may be forced to throw up his hands and call the whole thing off, leaving Edison to follow PG&E into chapter 11.
In the meantime, negotiations between Davis' staff, and staff from the Senate and Assembly continue.

We'll report back with information as we get it.

Individual Ex Parte Communication Meeting



As indicated by this ex parte notice, Edison is planning to meet with Bilas
this week before the continuation meeting on Thursday presumably to try to
weaken his opposition to the July 1 cut off of direct access.  Edison's
comments on the proposed decision say that over 6% of their load has
switched to direct access during the July 1 to September 6 time frame,
resulting in a total of over 7% of load being served by direct access over
their entire system at present.  While it appears Bilas is still a strong
proponent of allowing direct access and should still advocate reducing the
DWR contract commitements instead of restricting customer options, should
Enron, or AReM get in to see Bilas (and possibly Brown) to try to prevent
any backsliding on the 13th.  We have a right to a meeting with Bilas.  A
meeting with Brown would have to be noticed today or be held only with his
advisor, Dave Gamson. I would recommend we try for both.

Jeff - I know we are a bit tardy in getting back to you. I think a good place to start would be a close review and routine updates on the following:

1. PGT Gas Accord vs. attempt to convert jurisdiction to FERC in bankruptcy proceeding. As discussed, any delay in PG&E's ability to deal with the generators on a long term basis will facilitate bypass projects into the state.

2. Socal - resurrection of GIR or any plans to open the backbone to firm, path based transportation.

3. Southern Trails battle with Socal to gain access to firm takeaway capacity on SoCal's system and developments in Socal's RLS tariff.

4. Any issues that you believe affect our commercial efforts in California.

Obviously this is a small list. I would appreciate your feedback on issues that you believe to be critical drivers.

Regards,

Stephanie

Stephanie and I met with Jeff Dasovich in San Fransisco on Friday.  Jeff understands that he can play an important/strategic role in assisting ENA West Gas in understanding the regulated issues for Gas... There is no doubt that ENA has spent most of our resources in power ( and for good reason) however we need to re focus energy on gas related structures. 

To facilitate this effort, Jeff has offered to focus some more of his time and effort on coordinating some of the key commercial issues related to California.  Jane and Stephanie need to create a priority list that represents West Gas issues and ""Hot Button"" or action items. Once created we can work with Jeff on action items.  In addition to this immediate need, Jeff will join our conference call's/meetings ( or attend where possible).  The next session I have on my calendar is Thurs Sept 5 @ 2:30.  

I trust this initiative will further enhance an already effective procedure. If there are any questions, let me know.

Subject:	Angelides Trying to Turn Up Heat on Loretta

Calif. power bond delay may lead to large deficit 
NEW YORK, Sept 27 (Reuters) - California state Treasurer Philip Angelides said Thursday the state could face a $9.3 billion budget deficit in the 2002-2003 fiscal year if $12.5 billion of power bonds are not sold before July 2002. 
The treasurer is certain the bonds will be sold, but he released the figures in an attempt to pressure the California Public Utilities Commission (PUC) into actions it must take in order to sell the bonds. 
""What I am concerned about is the fact this law has not been effectuated eight months after it was passed,"" Angelides said in a telephone news conference in Sacramento, referring to a law passed in February setting the biggest municipal bond sale ever in motion. 
The state depleted its general fund by at least $6.2 billion buying electricity to keep power flowing and must sell the bonds in order to refill the state's general fund and make future power purchases. 
""There can be no schedule (for the bond sale) until the PUC completes its work,"" Angelides said. 
Earlier this week the PUC said the much-delayed meeting is now set for Oct. 2. 
Angelides said PUC Commissioner Jeff Brown, one of five, is on board to make the vote, but President Loretta Lynch and other commissioners, ""are not ready to act."" 
Lynch said earlier this week that she wants more time to work out details with Angelides and the Department of Water Resources concerning the money and terms of the rate order and rate agreement. 
How the money from rate increases approved in May will be split up to pay for the bonds and to reimburse troubled power utilities and giving the Department of Water Resources the authority to sell the bonds, still need to be decided by the PUC. 
Angelides is projecting a $3.1 billion budget deficit for the 2002-2003 fiscal year, even if the bonds are sold in time, due to reduced revenues as the overall U.S. economy slows. 
In a worst case scenario, Angelides added that with the bond sale, the $3.1 billion gap may grow to $4 billion, while a late sale would push the $9.3 billion number to $10.2 billion. 
The treasurer painted a dire picture of California 's budget if the bonds are not sold, likening it to the state's budget problems of the early 1990s. 
Angelides warned a 2 percent sales tax increase might have to be put in place, or possibly a $1,574 per student cut in state K-12 education spending. 
Or, the state could drop all spending on the University of California and California State University and save $6 billion. 
Eighteen percent of the state's non-education budget would need to be cut if the bonds are not sold, he said.

As soon as I saw the problem (early Sunday morning), I left a Voice message
on Jeff's phone, Prentice's phone and also a live message with the paging
service for Jeff.  When it was time to determine what to do (i.e., the games
were about to start),  I looked at the scores on Tennessee and Seattle and
both were fairly high in the picks - Tenn ave. of 10.  so I figured that you
must have meant to put 11 on one of your #12 teams.  I put the #12 on the
team that alphabetically came first, put 11 on Tennessee, and lowered all
remaining numbers to come back to 1.  (You did not have a 1 pick in what you
sent.)  I honestly did what I thought you were trying to do, so I'm sorry if
it wasn't the right thing.

Donna had come over to watch the game, so I couldn't really talk when you
called the last time and even though you were trying to give me what you
meant, the Seattle game was already over, so I don't think it would have
been fair to change it at that point.  

Did you have a marvelous time???  Did they like the tomatoes?

Subject:	Booked PX Credits


 << File: PX Summary 091401.xls >> 

Jeff,

I have attached a file showing the SCE receivable amount of ($109,292,004.75) Due Enron.  This amount is net of the payments made by SCE.  A few cautions, these amounts are reported more by Enron accounting month vs. utility bill cycle month.  But at least it highlights the rapid fall off starting in the March, when most of the customers had been returned to Bundled Utility Service. 

To obtain a more accurate projection of the receivable as of January 18, 2001 or at any point would require this information be sorted differently and require allocation assumptions to handle the bill cycle vs. accounting vs. PX end date. 

Hopefully this will be enough to get you ready for Monday's meeting.  Call me if you would like to discuss.  FYI, I have also included information re PG&E.   If you are asked, these amounts are directly from the utility bills, not an Enron's calculation.  

We have not really tried to ""tie"" these numbers with the utility, but in all cases these amounts were pulled directly from the utility bills.  Any errors would be due to omissions or query compilation errors.  EES could be prepared to actually reconcile these with SCE, if you give the go-ahead to do so.

By Michael B. Marois 
Sacramento, California, Sept. 27 (Bloomberg) -- A special legislative session to consider a rescue package for Edison International's insolvent California utility won't begin until Oct 9., aides for Governor Gray Davis said. 
The governor had been expected to call lawmakers back Oct. 2. His aides didn't explain the reasons for the delay. The governor plans to make an announcement at 3 p.m. San Francisco time, Davis spokeswoman Hilary McLean said. 
Southern California Edison, California's second-largest utility, accrued $3.9 billion in debt under the state's deregulation law, which froze consumer rates and let wholesale power costs rise. Some of the utility's creditors are trying to put together a group of three to force the company into bankruptcy. PG&E Corp.'s Pacific Gas & Electric, the state's largest utility, filed for bankruptcy in April. 
The Legislature adjourned Sept. 15 without approving a $2.9 billion rescue package, prompting Davis to announce he would call lawmakers back to Sacramento to consider a new plan. 
The latest Edison measure may let the utility sell $2.5 billion to $2.9 billion in bonds to pay off its debt, secured by existing rates on about 20 percent of its largest commercial customers, Davis aides said last week.",,289,0

3.	No incremental ""DASR'ing"":  The PUC includes incremental additions and subtractions of DA customer's load under the 	suspension of DA (e.g., fast food chains, University campus)

4.	Cost allocation: the PUC adds new costs to DA accounts and/or disproportionately shifts existing costs to DA accounts.  	Costs with greatest risk of being shifted to DA customers include: IOU undercollection, bonds to repay the state general fund, 	and DWR contracts.

With regard to Glen Thomas, I believe that he is the newly appointed chair who was previously Governor Tom Ridge's policy guy in the governor's office. I think he is pretty young (early thirties) and that he still has strong ties in that office and should be vocal on markets working and political leadership (the right kind!) being neccesary.

Attached for your review and comment is a draft application for rehearing of the Commission's Thursday Decision 01-09-060 suspending the right of direct access.  Although we have prevailed (at least for now) on the issue ofr etroactivity, the decision still violates various provisions of state andf ederal law.  If any party wishes to preserve the right to legally challenge this decision, it must file an application for rehearing within ten days.  The attached draft is tentatively dated September 28, meaning that it would be filed next Friday.
 
The primary reasons cited for why rehearing should be granted are asf ollows: 


The Decision violates procedural due process guarantees.

The failure to hold hearings violates Public Utilities Code section 1708.5(f).

 The Commission's reliance on material outside the record violates due process.

 The Decision violates the Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution.

 The threatened retroactivity is contrary to law and in excess of the Commission's authority.

 The Commission acted contrary to law and in excess of its authority.  

 The Decision's purported findings are not supported.

The Commission has impermissibly converted a ratemaking proceeding into a quasi-legislative proceeding.

Although WPTF members have not had an opportunity to consider whether they wish to support such a filing, WPTF is included as a named party in the attached because of the fact that AReM and WPTF have jointly made numerous other filings in this proceeding.  WPTF members will need to determine if they wish to support this effort.
 
I look forward to seeing your comments.  Thanks, and have a gtoodw eekend!

Greetings Eve and Bill:
This has been forwarded to Delainey and Dorothy.  It's originating with AreM.  Delainey's distributing to some, I'm distributing to others.  The Chamber's already agreed to join.  If we're to have any hope of a)m aintaining DA and b) eliminating any chance of a retroactive date, seems that we'll need as many folks signing on as possible.  Please see attached.

Subject: Draft Application for Rehearing


Attached for your review and comment is a draft application for rehearing of the Commission's Thursday Decision 01-09-060 suspending the right of direct access.  Although we have prevailed (at least for now) on the issue ofr etroactivity, the decision still violates various provisions of state andf ederal law.  If any party wishes to preserve the right to legally challenge this decision, it must file an application for rehearing within ten days.  The attached draft is tentatively dated September 28, meaning that it would be filed next Friday.
 
The primary reasons cited for why rehearing should be granted are asf ollows: 


The Decision violates procedural due process guarantees.

The failure to hold hearings violates Public Utilities Code section 1708.5(f).

 The Commission's reliance on material outside the record violates due process.

 The Decision violates the Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution.

 The threatened retroactivity is contrary to law and in excess of the Commission's authority.

 The Commission acted contrary to law and in excess of its authority.  

 The Decision's purported findings are not supported.

The Commission has impermissibly converted a ratemaking proceeding into a quasi-legislative proceeding.

Although WPTF members have not had an opportunity to consider whether they wish to support such a filing, WPTF is included as a named party in the attached because of the fact that AReM and WPTF have jointly made numerous other filings in this proceeding.  WPTF members will need to determine if they wish to support this effort.
 
I look forward to seeing your comments.  Thanks, and have a gtoodw eekend!

Extraordinary (Special) Session Rules and Procedures
Call of Special Session: 
Only the Governor has the authority to convene a special session of the Legislature. In convening the session, the Governor must issue a proclamation outlining the reasons for the special session, and only issues specified in the proclamation may be acted upon. 
Election of Special Session Officers, Committees and Bill Referrals: 
The election of officers and the appointment of special session committees are separate from the Legislature's regular session. In some instances, special session committees are comprised of different committee members than those appointed to regular session committees. 
Identification of Special Session Bills and Publications: 
Separate record-keeping publications (File, History, Journal and Roll Call) are printed for each individual extraordinary session. Special session bills are identified by specific paper colors (i.e. blue or green). For example, documents in the 2001 Second Extraordinary Session are printed on green paper. 
Introduction of Special Session Bills: 
There is no limit to the number of bills that a member of the Legislature may introduce during the extraordinary session, and none of the bills introduced during the extraordinary session count toward the member's bill limit in the Regular Session. 
Special Session Bill Procedures and Calendars: 
There is no bill introduction deadline during special sessions, and the ""30-day in print"" rule and committee file notice requirements do not apply. Special session bills also are not subject to the regular legislative session calendar, committee and/or floor deadlines. The sine die deadline requiring session to adjourn on November 30 of the second year of a legislative session does apply to the Special Session. 
Effective Date of Special Session Legislation: 
Simple majority vote special session bills take effect on the 91st day after the special session is adjourned. Urgency measures and other two-thirds majority-vote bills take effect immediately upon the Governor's signature. The Governor has 12 days from the date it is received on his desk to sign or veto legislation. Similar to the Regular Session, a special session bill may become law without the Governor's signature. 
End of Special Session: 
Only the Legislature, by concurrent resolution, may end a special session. The concurrent resolution takes effect upon passage by both houses of the Legislature, and is not subject to a Governor's signature or veto.",,484,0

Please let  us know if the list looks about right.

FYI:  Sue and I are scheduled to travel to Portland to sit down with Steve Swain & Co. in the attempt to ensure that the folks managing the book are well briefed on the regulatory risks.

Finally, note that though the risks listed below are linked to PUC actions, the California Legislature could take actions that could trigger the same risks.  For example, the Legislature could pass a bill directing the PUC how to allocate costs associated with the utilties' undercollection, the bonds issued to recover general fund money used to purchase power, DWR's long term contracts, etc. 

Best,
Jeff
  
1.	Retroactive Suspension of DA Contracts:  The PUC rules in a subsequent decision that DA is suspended on some date 	between July 1 and September 20th.  

2.	Contract renewal forbidden:  The PUC includes contract renewal under the suspension of DA.

3.	No incremental ""DASR'ing"":  The PUC includes incremental additions and subtractions of DA customer's load under the 	suspension of DA (e.g., fast food chains, University campus)

4.	Cost allocation: The PUC adds new costs to DA accounts and/or disproportionately shifts existing costs to DA accounts.  	Costs with the greatest risk of being shifted to DA customers include: IOU undercollection, bonds to repay the state general 	fund, and DWR contracts.  The costs associated with these categories are substantial. 

Additional suggestions from Mike Day:

5.	DASR processing :  If the utilities attempt to implement the Commission-ordered suspension in an onerous way, it may 	put at risk contracts executed prior to 09.20.01 but not yet DASR'd.

6.	Confidentiality of contract information:  The utilities and/or the PUC may require ESPs to show contracts as proof 		that contracts were executed prior to 09.20.01.",,456,0

State PUC seeks to void Davis's power contracts 
Deals gouge consumers, agency tells federal regulators 
In a move that could undermine California's hard-won control of the power market, state regulators are urging the federal government to throw out prices for some electricity contracts agreed to by Gov. Gray Davis. 
The state Public Utilities Commission, in what amounts to a rearguard action against the governor's power strategy, is arguing that some of the deals gouge Californians. The PUC says energy firms probably took advantage of the state's power crisis earlier this year to charge unfairly high prices, and it wants some of those prices cut. 
""The state is going to get itself into serious trouble with those contracts if they're not renegotiated,"" Commissioner Richard Bilas said. ""I would support anything that would help us get the prices of those contracts down."" 
The PUC apparently did not tell Davis administration officials that it was challenging the contracts before the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. 
""It's definitely not something that's a favorable thing to have happen to us,"" said Oscar Hidalgo, a spokesman for the state Department of Water Resources, which negotiated the contracts. 
Hidalgo said the long-term contracts, even though more expensive than current market prices, are the bulwark that protects the state from another round of spiraling spot market prices. 
""It would be a mistake to try to void those contracts out,"" Hidalgo said. ""If that's the goal, then we're back to square one. Prices would start to creep up."" 
The state is paying an average of $69 a megawatt hour under the contracts it has signed with private generators. Peak prices for electricity last week were less than $30. 
Hidalgo could not say whether the PUC actions could expose the state to lawsuits by the contractors or threaten a planned $12.5 billion bond issue to repay the state general fund for the power purchases. 
Over the past three months, lawyers for the PUC have filed challenges on various grounds before the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission against deals negotiated with PacifiCorp Power Marketing Inc., Alliance Colton LLC, Sempra Energy and a Calpine Corp. subsidiary, said PUC attorney Sean Gallagher. 
SEMPRA, CALPINE CONTRACTS
Taken together, Sempra and Calpine have sold about half the electricity that the Davis administration has agreed to buy in an array of 53 agreements, some of which last 20 years. In all, California has committed to spending at least $43 billion for electricity. 
The deal with PacifiCorp Power Marketing has already come under attack because while the state was negotiating the $1 billion contract, one of Davis' energy consultants owned stock in the power supplier's parent company. 
Gallagher said PUC attorneys may recommend commission actions against other contracts. 
Davis' spokesman Steve Maviglio said Friday the administration couldn't comment until it had studied the PUC submissions. 
The PUC's challenges mark the latest battle between Davis and the five- member commission, which is resisting administration energy policies even though it is controlled by the governor's three appointees. 
The commission has rebuffed Davis' attempts to nail down a mechanism for utility customers to cover the costs of the long-term power contracts and pay off the planned $12.5 billion bond issue. 
STATE TREASURER'S WARNING
State Treasurer Phil Angelides warned last week that the PUC's actions threatened to delay the bond issue and leave a $9 billion hole in the state budget next year. 
PUC President Loretta Lynch opposes the bond plan because it requires the commission to rubber-stamp the power contracts and forces the state to maintain a prolonged role as an energy buyer. 
""We should not, through the instrument of the bonds, lock down the policy choices for the state for 15 years,"" Lynch said last week. ""We should stay as flexible as possible. 
Lynch could not be reached for comment on the commission's challenges to the contracts. 
Commissioner Jeff Brown, Lynch's fellow Davis appointee, said the filings don't rule out Davis' bond financing deal. Nor do they threaten a state default on the long-term contracts, he said. But federal action could help the state improve the deals, he said. 
""The state of California has never consciously defaulted on a contract,"" he said. ""Even if we renegotiate, we'll renegotiate within the confines of the contract."" 
Hidalgo, however, said he doubted the state could modify the contracts. Under power granted by the Legislature, he said, the water department made its own finding that the contract prices were reasonable. 
Jan Mitchell, a spokeswoman for ScottishPower, parent company of PacifiCorp Power Marketing, said both sides agreed to the contract after full negotiations. 
""Now another California agency is disputing it,"" Mitchell said. ""We obviously disagree, and we'll continue to work with FERC, making sure the contracts are honored."" 
PUC CRITICAL OF DEALINGS
The PUC argues that the Portland energy firm wielded excessive market power when the state signed its 10-year, $1 billion deal with the company July 6. That forced the water department to accept unfair prices to avoid blackouts, the PUC says. 
""News reports suggest that the (water department) paid substantially over the then-current market prices for this contract, prices which will be passed through to California retail ratepayers,"" the PUC said. 
An energy consultant to Davis, Vikram Budhraja, admitted in August that he owned as much as $10,000 worth of Scottish Power stock while the deal was being worked out. Budhraja sold the stock July 30, and state officials said he had nothing to do with the PacifiCorp Power Marketing deal. 
Uncertainty over the contracts adds to growing turmoil in the state's energy picture. While the issue has slipped from the public eye, Davis' solutions to the energy crisis are meeting resistance not only from the PUC but from fellow Democrats in the state Senate, which has refused to pass his plan to stabilize Southern California Edison's finances and stave off a second utility bankruptcy filing. 
While officials fight among themselves, the energy industry is moving aggressively to reverse state efforts to put the brakes on deregulation.

Hidalgo could not say whether the PUC actions could expose the state to lawsuits by the contractors or threaten a planned $12.5 billion bond issue to repay the state general fund for the power purchases. 
Over the past three months, lawyers for the PUC have filed challenges on various grounds before the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission against deals negotiated with PacifiCorp Power Marketing Inc., Alliance Colton LLC, Sempra Energy and a Calpine Corp. subsidiary, said PUC attorney Sean Gallagher. 
SEMPRA, CALPINE CONTRACTS
Taken together, Sempra and Calpine have sold about half the electricity that the Davis administration has agreed to buy in an array of 53 agreements, some of which last 20 years. In all, California has committed to spending at least $43 billion for electricity. 
The deal with PacifiCorp Power Marketing has already come under attack because while the state was negotiating the $1 billion contract, one of Davis' energy consultants owned stock in the power supplier's parent company. 
Gallagher said PUC attorneys may recommend commission actions against other contracts. 
Davis' spokesman Steve Maviglio said Friday the administration couldn't comment until it had studied the PUC submissions. 
The PUC's challenges mark the latest battle between Davis and the five- member commission, which is resisting administration energy policies even though it is controlled by the governor's three appointees. 
The commission has rebuffed Davis' attempts to nail down a mechanism for utility customers to cover the costs of the long-term power contracts and pay off the planned $12.5 billion bond issue. 
STATE TREASURER'S WARNING
State Treasurer Phil Angelides warned last week that the PUC's actions threatened to delay the bond issue and leave a $9 billion hole in the state budget next year. 
PUC President Loretta Lynch opposes the bond plan because it requires the commission to rubber-stamp the power contracts and forces the state to maintain a prolonged role as an energy buyer. 
""We should not, through the instrument of the bonds, lock down the policy choices for the state for 15 years,"" Lynch said last week. ""We should stay as flexible as possible. 
Lynch could not be reached for comment on the commission's challenges to the contracts. 
Commissioner Jeff Brown, Lynch's fellow Davis appointee, said the filings don't rule out Davis' bond financing deal. Nor do they threaten a state default on the long-term contracts, he said. But federal action could help the state improve the deals, he said. 
""The state of California has never consciously defaulted on a contract,"" he said. ""Even if we renegotiate, we'll renegotiate within the confines of the contract."" 
Hidalgo, however, said he doubted the state could modify the contracts. Under power granted by the Legislature, he said, the water department made its own finding that the contract prices were reasonable. 
Jan Mitchell, a spokeswoman for ScottishPower, parent company of PacifiCorp Power Marketing, said both sides agreed to the contract after full negotiations. 
""Now another California agency is disputing it,"" Mitchell said. ""We obviously disagree, and we'll continue to work with FERC, making sure the contracts are honored."" 
PUC CRITICAL OF DEALINGS
The PUC argues that the Portland energy firm wielded excessive market power when the state signed its 10-year, $1 billion deal with the company July 6. That forced the water department to accept unfair prices to avoid blackouts, the PUC says. 
""News reports suggest that the (water department) paid substantially over the then-current market prices for this contract, prices which will be passed through to California retail ratepayers,"" the PUC said. 
An energy consultant to Davis, Vikram Budhraja, admitted in August that he owned as much as $10,000 worth of Scottish Power stock while the deal was being worked out. Budhraja sold the stock July 30, and state officials said he had nothing to do with the PacifiCorp Power Marketing deal. 
Uncertainty over the contracts adds to growing turmoil in the state's energy picture. While the issue has slipped from the public eye, Davis' solutions to the energy crisis are meeting resistance not only from the PUC but from fellow Democrats in the state Senate, which has refused to pass his plan to stabilize Southern California Edison's finances and stave off a second utility bankruptcy filing. 
While officials fight among themselves, the energy industry is moving aggressively to reverse state efforts to put the brakes on deregulation.

Glenn Thomas was the chief guy in the Gov office during PECO but was relatively quiet.  He is now the Chair of the PaPUC.  He will probably just discuss how wonderful a job PA is doing.  I don't think that he'll want to pick on Calif.  If you want to talk with him prior to the meeting, I can give him a call or Steve Montovano can arrange something.

Jeff--so what is a state librarian?  Must be a west coast kind of specialty!!

With regard to Glen Thomas, I believe that he is the newly appointed chair who was previously Governor Tom Ridge's policy guy in the governor's office. I think he is pretty young (early thirties) and that he still has strong ties in that office and should be vocal on markets working and political leadership (the right kind!) being neccesary.  Steffes might be able to give you more insight, but if my recollection is right, he wasn't involved in the early PECO fights--I think he came on the scene a little later.

Consumer Groups, Calif PUC Question Pwr Contract Validity 
LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--Two California consumer groups have asked California Attorney General Bill Lockyer to investigate whether some state electricity contracts should be nullified because of a possible conflict of interest held by one of the state's negotiations, according to a press release Monday. 
The Utility Reform Network and Consumers Union asked Lockyer to examine whether income earned from energy companies by consultant Vikram Budhraja presented a conflict of interest, because he may have been involved in contract negotiations with those companies
We believe there is ample evidence for the Attorney General to investigate whether some of the state's electricity contracts were made in violation of California's conflict of interest laws,"" said Bill Ahern, senior policy analyst with Consumers Union West Coast Regional Office. ""If the Attorney General finds that a contract was made in violation of the law, it must be set aside as void."" 
Three weeks after Budhraja's January hire date, Williams Companies (WMB <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/quotes/?symbol=WMB>, news <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/news/?symbol=WMB>, msgs <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/discuss/?symbol=WMB>) won a $3.4 billion contract to provide power to the state over 10 1/2 years. Budhraja disclosed in mid-August that his company, the Electric Power Group, was paid more than $10,000 by Williams during the previous 12 months. Budhraja was hired by the California Department of Water Resources to negotiate power contracts, but hasn't said which generators he dealt with in the weeks before the Williams contract was signed. 
""It is reasonable to assume that Budhraja may have been involved in the negotiations that led to the Williams contract,"" Ahern said. ""It is also likely that there are more detailed records and evidence in existence, which only a subpoena or search warrant may uncover."" 
The groups also are concerned that Budhraja may have held a conflict of interest due to his potential involvement in negotiating a $3.9 billion contract with Allegheny Energy Inc. (AYE <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/quotes/?symbol=AYE>, news <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/news/?symbol=AYE>, msgs <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/discuss/?symbol=AYE>) while he owned stocks in energy companies, according to the release. 
The Attorney General's office recently said it doesn't plan to investigate conflicts of interest involving energy contract negotiations. No one at the office could be reached for comment Monday. 
The California Public Utilities Commission is also petitioning federal regulators to throw out some of the state's $43 billion in long-term energy contracts, the San Francisco Chronicle reported Monday. 
The CPUC has argued in filings with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission over the past three months that energy companies took advantage of the state's energy crisis to negotiate high-priced contracts, according to the report. The average price of power under the contracts is $69 a megawatt-hour, more than double peak electricity prices last week. 
CPUC lawyers have filed challenges before the FERC on deals negotiated with Scottish Power (SPI <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/quotes/?symbol=SPI>, news <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/news/?symbol=SPI>, msgs <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/discuss/?symbol=SPI>) unit PacifiCorp, Alliance Colton LLC, Sempra Energy (SRE <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/quotes/?symbol=SRE>, news <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/news/?symbol=SRE>, msgs <http://quicken.excite.com/investments/discuss/?symbol=SRE>) and Calpine Corp.

Budhraja disclosed in August that he owned as much as $10,000 in Scottish Power stock while a $1 billion long-term contract with subsidiary PacifiCorp was being hammered out. The state signed the 10-year contract July 6. Budraha sold his stock July 30. State officials say Budhraja had nothing to do with the deal, according to the report.",71,1203

Calif PUC Postpones Vote On CDWR Rev Requirement




LOS ANGELES -- The California Public Utilities Commission has postponed until after Sept. 11 a vote to establish how much revenue the California Department of Water Resources will receive for power purchases through 2002, a spokeswoman said.

The CDWR has been buying power on behalf of the state's three investor-owned utilities since January. The CPUC decision would establish how much the CDWR could recover through rates from each utility for those power buys.

The proposed decision, originally scheduled for a vote Thursday, was made available for the first time Tuesday night. The vote on the proposal was postponed in order to allow time for parties to file comments, which are due by 5 p.m. Sept. 11.

A new date for a vote hasn't been set, but will occur ""some time after comments are received,"" the CPUC said in a press release.

Subject:	Meeting with Edison (John Fielder) re: Getting Edison to Pay Us What We're Owed for the PX Credit

Talked to John Fielder (SVP at the utility) this morning in an attempt to determine if Edison will come around and pay us the PX credit they owe us.

Summary of our offer:
Edison pays us 90% of what they owe us as of 01.17.01.
Payment structure: Edison pays us 10% immediately, with an agreed to (speedy) payment schedule for the remaining 90%.
In return, we drop our complaint against Edison at the PUC.
In return, we agree to a bottoms-up approach retroactive to March 1 to replace the current PX Credit/Residual CTC framework.

Fielder said that he didn't see any show-stoppers in our proposal, but had to check back on his end.  However, there were three additional issues that he wanted to add to any deal:
Some agreement regarding payment of Edison's undercollection (this would cover any of our DA customers who were bundled services customers pre-January 17). We agreed that this would only be an issue to the extent that the Legislature and/or the PUC agreed that Edison should get authority to recoup its undercollection in rates.
Some agreement on DWR stranded costs.  John expressed the view that DWR bought power under the assumption that the customers who've recently gone DA would be there to take the power, and now that they've left, they should contribute in some way to any stranded costs. I told John that this issue is a hornet's nest, that we were better off leaving it out, but we'd consider his proposals.
Some agreement on forebearance.  I told John that if Edison agrees to pay us, it didn't seem that forebearance would be off the table.

We agreed to touch base at the same time Wednesday morning.  The idea is that he'll get back to me with Edison's reaction to our proposal; and we'd get back to him on Edison's proposals.

Might be useful to determine whether we want to continue the discussions.  While John seemed very inclined to work something out, all signals are that the Legislature isn't inclinded to bail Edison out next week.  In which case, Edison could be in bankruptcy in a couple of weeks, which would presumably nullify any agreement we might reach with them. On the other hand, if the Legislature pulls a rabbit out of a hat, an agreement might have real value.

Any comments folks have on 1) Edison's proposals and 2) whether it makes sense to continue discussions on Wednesday are appreciated.  Seems that, at a minimum, if we agree to consider Edison's proposals, then our payment should go from 90 cents to 100 cents on the dollar.

I invited Jim S.

I was assuming that Paul would facilitate.  Paul can you make this meeting? If not Paul, I was assuming it would be Sue or you.

Here's my  suggested Agenda

1. Clarify scope of meeting.  Calif. coverage or the entire West?

2. GA staff goes down the list of key cases that affect the curve (T, D, and utility G) and identifies who's covering cases

3. URM gives feedback on areas of their curves that may not be in GA's ""radar""

4. Discussion over which cases should be monitoring mode and which we should be advocating a position.

Congratulations on side-stepping what many (including us) thought would be a summer filled with supply disruptions. We're as glad as anybody that it hasn't happened. 

I have a quick question:  Your consultant for gas procurement, a fellow named Mark Baldwin, until recently did some consulting work for one of our business units, Transwestern gas pipeline.  Mark has informed us that we won't be able to talk to him in his new role due to conflict of interest considerations that arise from our previous relationship with Mark.

With that in mind, I was wondering if there is someone else working on gas procurement other than Mark (who doesn't face the same conflict issues) that we could meet with to discuss providing low-cost gas services to California?  We're very cognizant of the importance of maintaining a conflict-free environment.  But it would be a shame for the state to forego a good gas deal for the state's consumers.  If there's someone we can talk to and avoid (even the appearance of) conflict-of-interest, we'd be very anxious to do so.

Thanks for your time and hope all is well.

If the Senate proceeds as Burton suggests, the chances are very low that an MOU will make it through the Legislature and get Davis' signature.
Burton generally sticks to his word. But there is still time for additional negotiations and SB78 could squeak by. However, Burton's comments in the Rules Committee certainly don't help 78's chances for survival.

This item was not on the Commission's agenda other than as a placeholder regarding ""litigation.""  We do not have copies of the agreement but we just talked to Edison's SVP of Regulatory Affairs and here's a summary:

The Commission will keep current rates in place through 2003
Any ""overcollection"" resulting from keeping current rates in place will go to paying off $3.3 B in Edison's past due accounts (the so-called ""undercollection"")
If Edison collects the $3.3B prior to 2003, then rates can change
If Edison has not collected the $3.3 B by the end of 2003, the PUC will create a dedicated rate component on all bills to collect the remainder.  Half the remainder will be collected in 2004 and the other half in 2005.
Any refunds received from litigation against suppliers will go to reducing the $3.3 B undercollection.
Edison can keep 10% of any refunds received after the $3.3B is paid off.
Edison cannot pay any dividends during the time that it is using rates to pay off the $3.3B.
Edison can apply to the PUC for approval to hedge gas price risk.
Edison will be protected from any increases in DWR contract costs (i.e., if DWR's costs go up, the PUC will raise rates rather than take it out of Edison's rates)
The PUC will not fine Edison during this period if Edison's capital structure varies from the PUC-approved capital structure
Edison must drop its lawsuits against the PUC regarding 1) the ""filed rate doctrine"" and 2) the so-called ""TURN"" accounting method, which effectively kept the rate freeze in place.
Edison agrees to ""cooperate"" with the Attorney General and the PUC in all litigation against suppliers.
The PUC decision could likely nullify the need for the ""special"" session that the Governor recently announced

We will report back with additional details as soon as we get them.

Subject:	California Update--10.02.01:  PUC Turns Down Davis' Proposed Rate Agreement with DWR

In what will likely be viewed as a fairly shocking event, the California PUC today voted down Davis' proposed rate agreement between DWR and the CPUC.
The vote was 4-1, with the two Republicans voting with Davis' hand-picked appointees Lynch and Wood.
Davis' proposal was introduced at the meeting by another Davis appointee--Geoff Brown--who made a lengthy speech about why California would experience economic and political destruction if the PUC did not approve Davis' proposed rate agreement.

What is Davis' proposed rate agreement between DWR and the CPUC?
It would remove all PUC authority to review any contracts between DWR with suppliers.
It would require the PUC to pass through to utility rates all DWR power contract costs, no questions asked.

What are the implications of the move by the PUC to reject Davis' proposal?
With the vote, it remains unclear how California/DWR will pay for the DWR power contracts.
The political pressure to re-negotiate--or break--the DWR power contracts is likely to intensify considerably.
It remains unclear how California/DWR will pay for the $12.5 B in bonds the Treasurer has unsuccessfully attempted to issue for past several months.
Under the structure devised by Davis, the revenues flowing from the CPUC/DWR rate agreement would be used to both 1) pay for the DWR power contracts and 2) service the bonds the Treasurer is trying to issue to repay California's General Fund for spot and other short term power purchased by DWR since January.
In short, there is no clear indication of how California will pay for DWR contracts or issue the bonds.
Safe to say that today's PUC vote has seriously embarrassed Davis, and left his approach to ""solving"" California electricity crisis in shambles.

What Next?
A broad left-right coalition of energy interests supported a bill (18XX) that passed the Legislature with broad bi-partisan support.

Proponents of the bill--and just about everyone else--argue that the ""dedicated rate component"" is a signficantly more efficient way to raise the debt California needs to plug the hole in its budget.
The bill is silent, however, on how California would pay for the DWR contracts, and the bill's opponents claim that the power suppliers will sue as a result.
All four PUC commissioners who voted against the Davis rate agreement today urged Davis to sign the bill.  The left-right coalition (from Nader types to oil companies) is also working hard to get Davis to sign it.
Davis has said that he will veto the bill on the advice of the Treasurer and bond counsel.
Given today's vote, however, Davis may have no alternative than to sign the bill if he wants to get the bonds issued and the state budget repaid.

Subject:	California Update--10.02.01:Part 2:  PUC Approves Edison Bailout

In another surprise move, the PUC approved an Edison bailout today on a 5-0 vote.  This item was not on the Commission's agenda other than as a placeholder regarding ""litigation.""  We do not have copies of the agreement but we just talked to Edison's SVP of Regulatory Affairs and here's a summary:

The Commission will keep current rates in place through 2003
Any ""overcollection"" resulting from keeping current rates in place will go to paying off $3.3 B in Edison's past due accounts (the so-called ""undercollection"")
If Edison collects the $3.3B prior to 2003, then rates can change
If Edison has not collected the $3.3 B by the end of 2003, the PUC will create a dedicated rate component on all bills to collect the remainder.  Half the remainder will be collected in 2004 and the other half in 2005.
Any refunds received from litigation against suppliers will go to reducing the $3.3 B undercollection.
Edison can keep 10% of any refunds received after the $3.3B is paid off.
Edison cannot pay any dividends during the time that it is using rates to pay off the $3.3B.
Edison can apply to the PUC for approval to hedge gas price risk.
Edison will be protected from any increases in DWR contract costs (i.e., if DWR's costs go up, the PUC will raise rates rather than take it out of Edison's rates)
The PUC will not fine Edison during this period if Edison's capital structure varies from the PUC-approved capital structure
Edison must drop its lawsuits against the PUC regarding 1) the ""filed rate doctrine"" and 2) the so-called ""TURN"" accounting method, which effectively kept the rate freeze in place.
Edison agrees to ""cooperate"" with the Attorney General and the PUC in all litigation against suppliers.
The PUC decision could likely nullify the need for the ""special"" session that the Governor recently announced

We will report back with additional details as soon as we get them.

Best,
Jeff

Subject:	California Update--10.02.01:  PUC Turns Down Davis' Proposed Rate Agreement with DWR

In what will likely be viewed as a fairly shocking event, the California PUC today voted down Davis' proposed rate agreement between DWR and the CPUC.
The vote was 4-1, with the two Republicans voting with Davis' hand-picked appointees Lynch and Wood.
Davis' proposal was introduced at the meeting by another Davis appointee--Geoff Brown--who made a lengthy speech about why California would experience economic and political destruction if the PUC did not approve Davis' proposed rate agreement.

What is Davis' proposed rate agreement between DWR and the CPUC?
It would remove all PUC authority to review any contracts between DWR with suppliers.
It would require the PUC to pass through to utility rates all DWR power contract costs, no questions asked.

What are the implications of the move by the PUC to reject Davis' proposal?
With the vote, it remains unclear how California/DWR will pay for the DWR power contracts.
The political pressure to re-negotiate--or break--the DWR power contracts is likely to intensify considerably.
It remains unclear how California/DWR will pay for the $12.5 B in bonds the Treasurer has unsuccessfully attempted to issue for past several months.
Under the structure devised by Davis, the revenues flowing from the CPUC/DWR rate agreement would be used to both 1) pay for the DWR power contracts and 2) service the bonds the Treasurer is trying to issue to repay California's General Fund for spot and other short term power purchased by DWR since January.
In short, there is no clear indication of how California will pay for DWR contracts or issue the bonds.
Safe to say that today's PUC vote has seriously embarrassed Davis, and left his approach to ""solving"" California electricity crisis in shambles.

What Next?
A broad left-right coalition of energy interests supported a bill (18XX) that passed the Legislature with broad bi-partisan support.
The bill would create a ""dedicated rate component"" on every customers bill to service the $12.5 B in bonds that the Treasurer wants to issue.
Proponents of the bill--and just about everyone else--argue that the ""dedicated rate component"" is a signficantly more efficient way to raise the debt California needs to plug the hole in its budget.
The bill is silent, however, on how California would pay for the DWR contracts, and the bill's opponents claim that the power suppliers will sue as a result.

But it also appears that what had been (a foreseeable and avoidable) energy crisis, is now by and large a pretty messy state fiscal and political crisis for our good friends in Sacramento, so I don't think that legislators, irrespective of their wishes, can avoid staying involved.
Add 18XX to the mix and the signing/veto process generally, and, well, Sacramento still seems pretty darned relevant.

Today, Dress Wounds.  Tomorrow Redress Grievances (Revised)
by Michael Rectenwald


<http://www.legitgov.org/sept11_wounds.html>
 
 
At this time, let us in the the pro-democracy movement give ourselves to the
heart of democracy -- by sharing our best selves with those in pain, in
need, in emergencies, and in unfathomable grief.  Let us focus in the
immediate on the spirit, the deeper soul and body of our nation-- to
address, with loving hearts, minds and hands, our physical, moral and
spiritual wounds, which wounds are so deep and many tonight. We are all
suffering tonight, but others suffer more than we do. Let us help them. Let
us suspend our grievances for a brief time, to focus on the well-being of
our fellow human beings.

Whether policies or an implacable history has delivered this day (and both
have arguably contributed), the day is ours, and we must gather its bleeding
members, and wrap ourselves around them, as bandages around lacerations.
Some of us were eyewitnesses to the tragedies of today, who had ""arms, legs,
and parts of people falling on our heads."" Our nation is poorer, our lives
are lessened, and our hearts are heavy tonight.

We who love democracy, and value the lives of all people equally, find
ourselves in a difficult predicament -- find ourselves being asked to rally
behind a leader who we know is not our leader, a ""leader"" who has, we
believe, already inflicted wounds on our nation, a leader who has our
nation's fate in his hands, and who has already endangered us. Our anger
towards what many of us felt was a likely eventuality under Bush --
unprecedented reprisals from parties hostile to the US and his policies --
is justified. We have warned and warned: Bush is dangerous domestically and
abroad. Now, under Bush, we have experienced another unprecedented assault
on our nation (following the first one delivered on Jan. 20) -- the worst
act of terrorism to hit the American citizens in the history of the nation.
We do not think that this attack under Bush's ""command"" represents a
meaningless coincidence. Rather, the events are linked, part of that
""inescapable web of mutuality"" that Martin Luther King referred to. There
was no escaping it -- a forcible takeover of the nation would have negative
consequences in and for the world.

The Bush political legacy, from GH to GW on down, has contributed greatly to
the ire directed at our citizens. That tensions in the Middle East have been
exacerbated by the ""laissez faire"" policies of the unilateralist Bush, that
Clinton was at least moving towards peace while under Bush's non-stewardship
the situation has approached anarchy, not many in the movement (and indeed,
the world) doubt. We must, in very short order, resume our assault on Bush's
international policies of unilateralism, bellicose posturing, and
treaty-breaking, and soon, before more casualties occur as a result. But at
the present moment, and I mean, in the very immediate moment, let us address
a deeper sense of democracy -- the right of life, liberty and the peaceable
pursuit of happiness of all peoples -- by taking care of immediate needs.
Let's tend to the immediate sense of morality -- loyalty and commitment to
those nearest us.

Therefore, for the brief duration of our imperilment, let's show some
restraint, with a foreknowledge of our greater purpose, in our outrage at
the ship's captain, and hope and work for the safe delivery of the ship.
Accusing Bush of deliberately causing the terrorism, for example, will not
help either the nation or our movement; it will hurt those in pain, and
alienate those who might otherwise concur with us. However, when delivered
from this hopefully short excursus into Hell, after reaching relatively safe
harbor, we can resume our work to oust the illegitimate ""captain.""   Our
commitment to the cause will have been no less -- rather, it will take on a
deeper significance.  We will have purified ourselves to a degree, and will
then be more fit for direct action. We will make sure our hearts are in the
right place -- that we have always only had the well-being and best
interests of our nation at heart.

Let us, then, attend to our own, and care for the nation, displaying our
own, deeper sense of patriotism -- one that loves our nation and people too
much to contribute to bellicose international posturing, and that also cares
too much to neglect our direct duties towards our fellow citizens and human
beings. The evils of today are more than enough for today.

Sincerely,

Today, Dress Wounds.  Tomorrow Redress Grievances (Revised)
by Michael Rectenwald


<http://www.legitgov.org/sept11_wounds.html>
 
 
At this time, let us in the the pro-democracy movement give ourselves to the
heart of democracy -- by sharing our best selves with those in pain, in
need, in emergencies, and in unfathomable grief.  Let us focus in the
immediate on the spirit, the deeper soul and body of our nation-- to
address, with loving hearts, minds and hands, our physical, moral and
spiritual wounds, which wounds are so deep and many tonight. We are all
suffering tonight, but others suffer more than we do. Let us help them. Let
us suspend our grievances for a brief time, to focus on the well-being of
our fellow human beings.

Whether policies or an implacable history has delivered this day (and both
have arguably contributed), the day is ours, and we must gather its bleeding
members, and wrap ourselves around them, as bandages around lacerations.
Some of us were eyewitnesses to the tragedies of today, who had ""arms, legs,
and parts of people falling on our heads."" Our nation is poorer, our lives
are lessened, and our hearts are heavy tonight.

We who love democracy, and value the lives of all people equally, find
ourselves in a difficult predicament -- find ourselves being asked to rally
behind a leader who we know is not our leader, a ""leader"" who has, we
believe, already inflicted wounds on our nation, a leader who has our
nation's fate in his hands, and who has already endangered us. Our anger
towards what many of us felt was a likely eventuality under Bush --
unprecedented reprisals from parties hostile to the US and his policies --
is justified. We have warned and warned: Bush is dangerous domestically and
abroad. Now, under Bush, we have experienced another unprecedented assault
on our nation (following the first one delivered on Jan. 20) -- the worst
act of terrorism to hit the American citizens in the history of the nation.
We do not think that this attack under Bush's ""command"" represents a
meaningless coincidence. Rather, the events are linked, part of that
""inescapable web of mutuality"" that Martin Luther King referred to. There
was no escaping it -- a forcible takeover of the nation would have negative
consequences in and for the world.

The Bush political legacy, from GH to GW on down, has contributed greatly to
the ire directed at our citizens. That tensions in the Middle East have been
exacerbated by the ""laissez faire"" policies of the unilateralist Bush, that
Clinton was at least moving towards peace while under Bush's non-stewardship
the situation has approached anarchy, not many in the movement (and indeed,
the world) doubt. We must, in very short order, resume our assault on Bush's
international policies of unilateralism, bellicose posturing, and
treaty-breaking, and soon, before more casualties occur as a result. But at
the present moment, and I mean, in the very immediate moment, let us address
a deeper sense of democracy -- the right of life, liberty and the peaceable
pursuit of happiness of all peoples -- by taking care of immediate needs.
Let's tend to the immediate sense of morality -- loyalty and commitment to
those nearest us.

Therefore, for the brief duration of our imperilment, let's show some
restraint, with a foreknowledge of our greater purpose, in our outrage at
the ship's captain, and hope and work for the safe delivery of the ship.
Accusing Bush of deliberately causing the terrorism, for example, will not
help either the nation or our movement; it will hurt those in pain, and
alienate those who might otherwise concur with us. However, when delivered
from this hopefully short excursus into Hell, after reaching relatively safe
harbor, we can resume our work to oust the illegitimate ""captain.""   Our
commitment to the cause will have been no less -- rather, it will take on a
deeper significance.  We will have purified ourselves to a degree, and will
then be more fit for direct action. We will make sure our hearts are in the
right place -- that we have always only had the well-being and best
interests of our nation at heart.

Let us, then, attend to our own, and care for the nation, displaying our
own, deeper sense of patriotism -- one that loves our nation and people too
much to contribute to bellicose international posturing, and that also cares
too much to neglect our direct duties towards our fellow citizens and human
beings. The evils of today are more than enough for today.

Sincerely, 
 
 
Michael Rectenwald

Based on your voicemail, here's a quick-and-dirty synopsis of a proposal that I've been quietly discussing with a select few out here in California (e.g., John White, large customers).  It could include more bells and whistles, but the intent of this proposal is to get DA back as soon as possible.
**************************************************************************

Reduce DWR L-T contract volumes by at least 33-50%
To ""back fill"" increase in net-short created by contract reformation, permit noncore customers (20 KW and above) to elect to go DA to fill the position
DA provides a significantly more efficient hedge against price volatility than DWR contracts
Election is first-come, first-serve, capped at the aggregate net short position
Customers decision to go DA will constitute a 3-year commitment to stay DA (i.e., can't go back to IOU for 3 yrs; must stay in the market)
If a net short position remains after noncore customers have elected DA (i.e., not enough elect to fill the net short), then the IOUs will hold an auction to fill the net short
The auction would seek a portfolio of 3 month, 6 month, 1 year and 3 year deals (both peak and off-peak) to fill the net short.
Noncore customers choosing DA would not escape costs of DWR power consumed when the customer was receiving utility service (i.e., prior to electing DA)
Likewise, if the noncore customers choosing DA was a utility customer during the period when the utility accured its ""undercollection,"" (i.e., when wholesale prices exceeded the retail cap), the customer would not escape those costs by virtue of electing DA status
Noncore customers would not bear responsibility for recovery of DWR L-T contracts.
Potential add-on to deal:  Core customers (less than 20 KW) could choose ""green only"" DA, but, like, noncore customers could not escape costs for which they are responsible.",,430,0

A typical clause reads as follows:

"" 'Taxes' means any and all new or existing governmental or quasi-governmental taxes, assessments, levies, duties, fees, charges and withholdings of any kind or nature whatsoever and howsoever described, including gross receipts, franchise, sales, use , property, excise, capital, stamp, transfer, employment, occupation, generatiion, privilege, Utility Taxes [separately defined to include ""any and all franchise, utility, regulatory, BTU or energy, gross receipts, administrative services, municipality, and utility user taxes and similar taxes and energy resource and municipal land use surcharges and other similar surcharges""], regulatory, BTU, energy, consumption, lease, transaction, license, filing, recording, and activity taxes, levies, duties, fees, charges and withholdings, together with any and all penalties, fines, interest, and additions thereto, but excluding any taxes on the net income of EESI or any affilitates.""

Under the contracts the Buyer is usually responsible for taxes ""applicable to Power at or after the Delivery Point"" (the meter); the Seller is usually responsible for taxes ""applicable prior to the Delivery Point.""  The surcharge would seem to be applicable ""at the Delivery Point.""

Support for the argument that the surcharge is not a ""tax"" under the contracts:

     1.  The CPUC refers to it as a ""rate increase""

     2.  It was not imposed by a governmental body (such as a state, county, or municipality)

     3.  When first implemented, all proceeds went to the utilities

     4.  It appears that a portion of the proceeds may continue to go to the utilities

Support for the argument that the surcharge is a ""tax"" under the contracts:

     1.  Since the ""frozen tariff"" remains in place it is disingenuous to refer to it as a ""rate increase""

     2.  It now appears that the proceeds will go to a governmental entity, the DWR

     3.  The definition of ""taxes"" under the contract is broad and includes surcharges of all types

     4.  To the extent the $.01 surcharge is to pay for generation for bundled customers, those on direct access receive, if anything, only an indirect benefit, which is similar in effect to a tax and not to a rate increase",114,735

CEO and President's of your company/energy client.

Jim Brulte and Dave Cox asked Reliant to host a lunch for them with energy
industry executives in Houston and we will be doing do on October 29th.
Jim and Dave will be making follow up calls to the principals.  I wanted
you each to know this was happening and see the invitation.  The financial
commitment is attached to attending the lunch but the pitch will be made to
support the Senate/Assembly Leadership account at the CA Republican Party.

This invitation is only going to energy industry executives, although there
is a possibility a few other Texas companies might be included.

Expect a call from Jeff Miller encouraging you to support attending when
asked by your client/company.

Hope to see you in Houston on the 29th.

Subject: Update on the Implementation of the Suspension of Direct Access


Below is a summary of the events which have been occurring since last week's
meeting between the UDCs and ESPs re the implementation of the suspension of
direct access:

1. On October 3rd, a small working group comprised of representatives of the
three UDCs, Enron, Commonwealth and UC/CSU had a conference call to discuss
the filing of a joint proposal on the numerous issues surrounding the
implementation of the suspension of direct access.  While SCE was
represented on the call, it was clear that they were not interested in a
joint proposal and would file their own plan.  On the call, drafting
assignments were divvied up and another call was scheduled for Tuesday the
9th.

2.  On October 4h (as directed by the decision suspending DA), the UDCs
submitted letters to the Energy Division on their progress in implementing
the suspension.  PG&E and SDG&E submitted a joint letter which basically set
forth what they had done to date and their progress of working with the
ESPs.  They stated that they anticipated filing a joint proposal with the
ESPs soon.  SCE, however, was more specific in its submission.  Therein, SCE
states that ""SCE will not accept connect DASRs after October 20, 2001."" The
submittal also states that ""SCE will not process connect DASRs for service
accounts which did not exist on September 20, 2001.""

3. On October 9th, a conference call was held between SDG&E, PG&E, Enron,
Commonwealth, NewWest and UC/CSU.  At that time, SDG&E and PG&E informed the
ESPs that they would not be able to file a joint proposal.  That, instead,
they would be filing an advice letter (probably joint between the two UDCs)
which proposed a connect DASR cut off date. While a definitive date was not
stated, they indicated that it would be around the end of the year.

4. PG&E and SDG&E stated that they would file such advice letters by the end
of the week.  Parties would have approximately 10 days to respond.",47,542

We did originally file that the replacement for the PX Credit should be the DJ Index.  My recollection is that we did withdraw this argument, however I've include Sue Mara on this to double check.  If we haven't, I'd guess that is no longer URM's position?

Based on your voicemail, here's a quick-and-dirty synopsis of a proposal that I've been quietly discussing with a select few out here in California (e.g., John White, large customers).  It could include more bells and whistles, but the intent of this proposal is to get DA back as soon as possible.
**************************************************************************

Reduce DWR L-T contract volumes by at least 33-50%
To ""back fill"" increase in net-short created by contract reformation, permit noncore customers (20 KW and above) to elect to go DA to fill the position
DA provides a significantly more efficient hedge against price volatility than DWR contracts
Election is first-come, first-serve, capped at the aggregate net short position
Customers decision to go DA will constitute a 3-year commitment to stay DA (i.e., can't go back to IOU for 3 yrs; must stay in the market)
If a net short position remains after noncore customers have elected DA (i.e., not enough elect to fill the net short), then the IOUs will hold an auction to fill the net short
The auction would seek a portfolio of 3 month, 6 month, 1 year and 3 year deals (both peak and off-peak) to fill the net short.
Noncore customers choosing DA would not escape costs of DWR power consumed when the customer was receiving utility service (i.e., prior to electing DA)
Likewise, if the noncore customers choosing DA was a utility customer during the period when the utility accured its ""undercollection,"" (i.e., when wholesale prices exceeded the retail cap), the customer would not escape those costs by virtue of electing DA status
Noncore customers would not bear responsibility for recovery of DWR L-T contracts.
Potential add-on to deal:  Core customers (less than 20 KW) could choose ""green only"" DA, but, like, noncore customers could not escape costs for which they are responsible.",319,481

Nevada PUC Acts To Change Or Void Long-Term Pwr Contracts 
LOS ANGELES -(Dow Jones)- The Nevada Public Utilities Commission Wednesday voted to allow its General Counsel Office to take any action necessary to try to void or renegotiate long-term electricity contracts entered into by the state's two largest utilities, a PUC spokeswoman said. 
The contracts would force Sierra Pacific Resources' (SRP) utilities Sierra Pacific Power Co. and Nevada Power Co. to pay a higher price for power than current market rates, said Don Soderberg, PUC chairman. 
""We paid high prices when the prices were high, but to pay high prices when the prices are low is outrageous,"" Soderberg said. 
No one at Sierra Pacific or Nevada Power was available to comment on which companies have signed contracts with the utilities, or the value of the contracts. 
The PUC action follows a letter sent by Gov. Kenny Guinn to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in early October asking that the utilities be allowed to renegotiate the contracts. 
The General Counsel's office will now have authority to file with FERC and in court to plead against the current contracts. 
Sierra Pacific has said that a June FERC order that capped wholesale power prices has penalized the company. Sierra Pacific signed its forward contracts to escape high spot market prices, only to have those contracts end up being more expensive than the capped spot market prices, the company has said. As well, if the company wants to sell any surplus power into the spot market, it will now receive less for that power under the cap, it has said. 
California 's Public Utilities Commission is also pushing for renegotiation of $43 billion in long-term contracts signed by the state, which has been buying power on behalf of cash-strapped utilities since January.",,384,0

Subject: Davis devises new borrowing plan 


Davis devises new borrowing plan 
His executive order could speed up $12.5 billion in bond sales and
bypass PUC oversight of repayment mechanism. 
SACRAMENTO -- Gov. Gray Davis is crafting a new plan to expedite the
long-delayed borrowing of $12.5 billion to repay the sagging California
state budget for emergency electricity it bought during the energy
crisis. 
The plan -- which could be contained in an executive order as early as
next week -- would minimize the role of the state's top power regulator,
the Public Utilities Commission, which enraged Davis last week when it
declined to sign off on his original plan. 
With enough power now under contract to avert blackouts and plans in
place for the recovery of the two state's largest utilities, the
repayment to the state treasury would resolve one of the last remaining
issues of the energy crisis. 
""That is one scenario,"" Davis spokeswoman Hilary McLean said Wednesday
when asked about the proposal. ""There are a number of different
scenarios being considered. Nothing has jelled yet that is ready to be
publicly announced."" 
Most involved in the debate have long agreed that the state should sell
$12.5 billion in revenue bonds, most of which, about $9.6 billion, would
go back into the state treasury. The issue was how to lock in a
mechanism by which the bonds would be repaid - a critical step before
they could be marketed to investors. 
Davis wanted the PUC to approve a plan that would repay the bonds and
cover the state's energy costs through the revenues collected from
ratepayers. But the PUC said the administration's proposal might prove
inadequate over time, leading to future rate hikes. 
The PUC also said the administration's plan gave too much authority to
the Davis-controlled Department of Water Resources, by allowing the
department to raise electricity rates to get more revenue. 
The PUC, which is set up to be an independent board with the sole
responsibility for setting utility rates, did not want to cede that
authority. It rejected the Davis plan Oct. 2 on a 4-1 vote, led by its
president, Davis appointee Loretta Lynch. 
Davis earlier said the commission's approval was necessary to reassure
investors and get the bonds to market. 
The plan now under review, however, would bypass that. 
The DWR would not directly set rates, but under the Davis plan it would
be charged with identifying how the money coming in from customers'
utility bills over the next 20 years would be allocated - in effect,
guaranteeing that paying back the bonds would have equal priority with
paying back the suppliers of the energy. Proponents of the plan believe
that would satisfy Wall Street. 
The administration believes it would require no additional rate hikes. 
Lynch said Wednesday that she had not been involved in the latest
negotiations, but questioned whether Davis had the authority to issue an
executive order allowing the DWR to get involved in setting rates. 
""I've been told for six months that the PUC was needed to pass a rate
agreement. If the DWR can get the bonds sold by themselves, then great,""
Lynch said. ""But to dedicate rates, it takes a financing order from the
PUC or a statutory change in law, a statutory set-aside. It takes one of
those two things."" 
The governor is likely to announce the plan sometime following his
expected veto of the bill that lays out the Legislature's version of the
payback plan. By law, the governor has until Sunday to act on SB18xx, by
Senate Leader John Burton, D-San Francisco. 
Davis opposes Burton's bill because it gives bond buyers priority in
getting paid, followed by the energy suppliers. The power companies'
contracts contain provisions giving them payment priority, which Davis
believes could throw the contracts into legal dispute. 
If Davis signs the order soon, the bonds could go to market early next
year. Having the proceeds in the state treasury by then is considered by
some critical with the state facing a projected $4 billion to $6 billion
shortfall in other income.

FYI.  Hirsch apparently is a business reporter for the Times who got my name from people.  He's doing a story about the contracts.  Something like ""they bought way too much for too high a price.  Now what?""  I told him that I would talk to him under the following conditions:

No attribution to Enron specifically
No attribution of the ""unnamed sources"" sort, ""industry sources"" or sort, etc.
If, when the story's further along, he wants to try to get a quote from us, I'd put him in touch with our PR folks.

We talked generally about DWR, the CA Power Authority, the contracts, the Edison deal with the PUC, etc.

More specifically, he asked me ""are there any alternatives to deal with this mess.""  I outlined the following proposal, which we've talked about internally, and which we've been quietly shopping behind the scenes.  I did not bring up the ""green only"" DA for small customers piece of the proposal (slipped my mind).

I also gave him names of other folks I thought he should talk to.  He said he might get back to me.  If he calls back, I'll let you know.  

Please let me know if anyone has any concerns 1) about talking to him on a backgound only basis, and/or 2) the proposal outlined below. Thanks.

Based on your voicemail, here's a quick-and-dirty synopsis of a proposal that I've been quietly discussing with a select few out here in California (e.g., John White, large customers).  It could include more bells and whistles, but the intent of this proposal is to get DA back as soon as possible.
**************************************************************************

Reduce DWR L-T contract volumes by at least 33-50%
To ""back fill"" increase in net-short created by contract reformation, permit noncore customers (20 KW and above) to elect to go DA to fill the position
DA provides a significantly more efficient hedge against price volatility than DWR contracts
Election is first-come, first-serve, capped at the aggregate net short position
Customers decision to go DA will constitute a 3-year commitment to stay DA (i.e., can't go back to IOU for 3 yrs; must stay in the market)
If a net short position remains after noncore customers have elected DA (i.e., not enough elect to fill the net short), then the IOUs will hold an auction to fill the net short
The auction would seek a portfolio of 3 month, 6 month, 1 year and 3 year deals (both peak and off-peak) to fill the net short.
Noncore customers choosing DA would not escape costs of DWR power consumed when the customer was receiving utility service (i.e., prior to electing DA)
Likewise, if the noncore customers choosing DA was a utility customer during the period when the utility accured its ""undercollection,"" (i.e., when wholesale prices exceeded the retail cap), the customer would not escape those costs by virtue of electing DA status
Noncore customers would not bear responsibility for recovery of DWR L-T contracts.
Potential add-on to deal:  Core customers (less than 20 KW) could choose ""green only"" DA, but, like, noncore customers could not escape costs for which they are responsible.",38,1150

Jeff, I was talking to Mike Etringer yesterday regarding this subject and he gave me the name of the CFO Ted Craver. I understand that you guys were dealing with John Fielder.  
 
For sure we want to know what they are up to.  I think like all deals in California we are going to run into issues with credit, and probably paper but that would pretty much depend on the counterparty. ( is it edison), or DWR? 
 
It is VERY important that trading and marketing are aware of the hedging activities in a very timely fashion so however we need to ensure that happens will be my plan. 
 
Do you know the CFO ? 
 
regards, BT

All,

I think I actually was the one who proposed it in a 1998 ""RAP"" case three years ago.  The case is long closed and our suggestion was not accepted.  Therefore, we don't have to worry about it. If we like the idea, we would have to find a way to propose it anew -- if we don't like the idea, we just fail to bring it up again.

We did recommend using the DJ index.  But subsequent to that, I believe we filed as part of the ""ARM"" coalition, recommending a bottom's-up approach.  Is that right Sue?  However, I don't think it's accurate to say that we ""withdrew"" the DJ index recommendation.  Both our original DJ recommendation, and the bottom's up recommendation, are still sitting at the PUC.  I think that's how things currently stand.

We did originally file that the replacement for the PX Credit should be the DJ Index.  My recollection is that we did withdraw this argument, however I've include Sue Mara on this to double check.  If we haven't, I'd guess that is no longer URM's position?

We went into the FERC proceeding believing that the Chief ALJ was not
likely to give us a good decision.  During the course of the proceeding, we
convinced ourselves that he would rule our way due to the vast evidence in
our favor and the relatively inept presentation of El Paso and El Paso
Merchant Energy.  Well, despite the voluminous record in support of our
position, the judge ruled that it was ""not at all clear"" that El Paso
exercised market power.  The good news for your affiliates is that, if the
Commission does not find the exercise of market power in this case, it
never will.  We hope when the Commission reviews the entire record,
including the ""protected material"", they will change the ALJ's finding.  On
some level we believe that the ALJ just does not like California.  He is
the judge, after all, who told Harold Ray in the electric generation
settlement discussions that he was ""an asshole"".  The ironic part of the
decision is that we felt that a determination by the ALJ that defined the
market in such a way as to preclude EPME having market power would be
difficult to overcome at the Commission level.  Instead, he defined the
market as we suggested and found that El Paso had market power; he simply
failed to be convinced that they were withholding capacity despite the fact
that they utilized their capacity 54% of the time when everyone else was
utilizing their own capacity at a capacity factor of between 85% and 90%.
Go figure.

I am still less than enchanted with the NGS settlement  after SoCalGas
tailored it to their interests but am glad that the Commission is at least
considering opening up the system ala PG&E.   I think that they are
reasonably aware that SoCalGas was not blameless in the runup in gas prices
that took place last December.   Having said that we are having a hell of a
time in the GCIM simply trying to investigate what really happened.
SoCalGas latest excuse for not giving us info is that we will ""competitors""
with them (as a result of the filed rate litigation) for gas hedges.  I
must have misunderstood; I did not realize there was a limited supply of
hedges available and that there was competition for those ""available""
hedges.   Anytime Enron wants to help on these GCIM issues, we would
welcome it--might make you look less like a Texas robber baron.

Subject: ML Power Group-EIX-Update Following Meeting With Management


* We met with Edison management on Friday (10/12) to discuss the recently
announced settlement agreement between the company and the CPUC.  The
agreement, which was approved by Judge Lew on 10/5, provides a framework for
Edison to repay creditors on a Q1 2002 time frame and, ultimately, to resume
power procurement responsibilities.
* Edison?s current estimate is that past power procurement debts will be
recovered by year-end 2003.  Discussions are ongoing with banks regarding a
bridge loan, which is key in terms of getting creditors paid on time.
* Negotiations with the renewable QF generators continue with both sides
apparently seeking a fixed-price contract.  The main issue is likely to be
timing of the switch to a new pricing formula, particularly as there will
likely be a substantial increase over current payments indexed to gas
prices.
* Regarding other generator creditors, Edison will be pursuing a negotiated
settlement.  One key date in this process is March 31, 2002, after which
Edison is committed to join the state and the CPUC in pursuing legal action
to recover alleged generator overcharges.
* One option is a so-called ?grand agreement? under which Edison would agree
on the starting amount owed to each generator.  This would potentially
release Edison to negotiate with the individual generators directly, as
opposed to through the PX/ISO.
* Edison expects to provide more detail of its earnings outlook within a few

* Several key accounting issues need to be resolved first, notably whether
or not the PROACT (Procurement Related Obligations Account) will be set up
as a regulatory asset.  Another key issue outstanding is the utility
retained generation (URG) rate proceeding currently under way at the CPUC.
* Given the above uncertainties, it is still difficult to be precise about
the earnings impact of the Edison settlement.  For the time being we are
sticking with our 2002E of $1.60, comprising $1.40 from the utility and
$0.20 for the non-regulated businesses and parent.  There is potential
upside to our numbers, particularly if previous tax sharing arrangements are
restored under the terms of the settlement agreement.
* Edison is trading at 9.6x our 2002E, only modestly below the group average
multiple.  We see only modest upside from here at this stage, although
clarity on the non-regulated outlook is a potential positive catalyst.",77,748

Jeff,
John White has proposed to the CEERT Board that we send the attached letter to the Governor attacking the DWR contracts. Would you please take a look at it and let me know what you think of it.  You can reach me on my cell phone at 213-359-0853. Thanks.

Subject:	RE: CA question

Before we carry this much further, let me explain some more why I raised the question in the first place.

We currently assume that our exposure to CTC going forward is zero.  Arthur Andersen was questioning this assumption, as market prices in general are lower than embedded gen now (unless you include DWR costs), which implies that if we were under the old CTC regime we could be paying some positive CTC.  AA was wondering why we weren't holding some reserves for this eventuality.

Mary Lynne and I told them we weren't reserving b/c we just have no clear idea what will happen in the coming months re:CTC, but that in all likelihood zero is the best guess b/c no one can agree on what PX credit (""market"" price) is now that there is no PX.  Besides, though SCE and PG&E are arguing for different methods (the so-called ""top-down"" and ""bottom-up""), in the end the result will be about the same (CTC=0), especially now that PG&E has supposedly stopped ""adjusting"" the PX credit to recover past undercollections.  And of course, the DWR contracts muddy the waters, since if one includes them in the calculation of utility gen costs, then you could easily get to a negative CTC situation.  Bottom line: we think things are so screwed up that everyone will prefer just to ignore CTC for the few months remaining that it has to run.

In light of all this we thought we might further quell AA's skepticism if we could show that although we had once argued that DJI should be used as a substitute for PX credit, we were now simply arguing that DA should pay T&D only, and that CTC should become a relic of the past.

I think by now it may be a dead issue -- I believe AA has accepted our arguments w/o this extra bit of persuasion, else I would have heard more from Mary Lynne.  Thanks for all the background and input from everyone, and please let me know if you have any more relevant comments given this context.

It was $100 for each couple for everything. But you got a lot of people onto 
the reef, so if you want to take that off the bill, that's fine, too.

I guess I'll see you tonight? The chefs are going to cook something up. By 
the way, we stopped in Graton yesterday and went to Scala (because Willow 
was closed, to my utter dismay). But Scala was damn good. We had the Dutton 
Pinot, which was great. I had a homemade ravioli that really hit the spot.

See you later,

Scott

P.S. I agree with everything that guy said in the article you sent out. 
Pacifism is just not feasible in most situations. The world can be too 
selfish and evil for something so extreme to be effective more than 15% of 
the time. We have to go after those motherfuckers. And then be very 
responsible in the aftermath.

Jeff,

My colleague Joel Schwartz and I are looking for a concise summary of
the typical siting/permitting process for a plant in California,
including steps in the process, number of agencies, and average length.
Any ideas?

Thanks again for your great remarks last Friday; I really appreciated
them.

Today, October 9, 2001, Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&E) filed an
application with the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC).

In this application, PG&E proposes a market structure and rules for the
northern California natural gas industry, beginning 
January 1, 2003.  PG&E's filing was in response to a recent Commission order
(Decision 01-09-016), which directed PG&E to file a ""Gas Accord II""

Jerry,

First off I would like to again commend you on your presentation yesterday.  It would be an understatement to say that the last year's worth events have been amazing at best.

As we discussed at lunch, Enron has developed a unique approach to QF contract restructuring.  The main premise is that of conducting a dual auction to determine, on a completely voluntary and open process, the QF buyout economics and the market clearing price for replacement energy.  As discussed yesterday, I am enclosing copies of the presentations made to PG&E and SCE on this topic.  I would be very interested in your feedback on this concept and on the presentations provided.  I must footnote that the economic shown in the presentations are Enron estimates.  Individual feedback, particularly in this area would be appreciated.

Jeff Dasovitch out of our SF office has been working with me on this proposal and will likely be contacting you within the next day to further discuss this idea as well as the benefits and possible strategies for  initiating such an auction process.

Thanks for your time and look forward to hearing from you.

Best Regards,
Mike

Those comments refer to the ability to continue to submit DASRs for new facilities under contracts signed prior to September 20th that provide for facility adds.
The Commission agreed and has ordered the utilities to accept DASRs for facility adds under contract terms executed prior to 10.20.01.  The precise language is cited below.
If you would like a copy of the decision, please contact Joseph Alamo.

Best,
Jeff

""We reaffirm that for the time being, and unless the Commission states otherwise in a subsequent decision, utilities are required to process DASRs relating to contracts or agreements that were executed on or before September 20th, 2001, including DASRs for service to new facilities or accounts if the underlying contract pursuant to which those DASRs are submitted allowed for the provision of that additional service.  Thus, for example, with respect to the specific ESP contract described by UC/CSU in their rehearing application, the utilities are required to accept, even after September 20, 2001, any DASRs they receive that legitimatley relate to that contract...[W]e want to make it clear that...utilities cannot set a deadline after which they could refuse to process DASRs relating to contracts executed on or before September 20, 2001.""  pp 20-21",,364,0

Enron agrees to provide files, averts Senate contempt finding 
By Emily Bazar
Bee Capitol Bureau
(Published Sept. 14, 2001) 
State lawmakers moved to drop contempt charges against Enron Corp. on Thursday after the energy marketer agreed to begin turning over thousands of pages of documents immediately. 
The last-minute wrangling between Enron and a special Senate committee investigating energy price manipulation essentially brought to an end a series of extraordinary legislative proceedings that were last invoked in 1929. 
Following hours of closed-door meetings, Enron signed an agreement in the early evening, allowing it to dodge an impending contempt finding by the full Senate and the possibility of stiff fines. 
Under the deal, Enron will begin sharing records with the committee in exchange for a confidentiality agreement intended to protect its most sensitive documents after they are turned over. 
""It took too long to bring this to resolution,"" said state Sen. Joe Dunn, D-Santa Ana, who chairs the committee. ""I can't help but think it had to do with the pending sanctions for contempt."" 
As part of the deal, however, Enron did not agree to drop the lawsuit it filed in July asking the court to intervene on its behalf, said spokeswoman Karen Denne. She said the company is still considering its options. 
""We're pleased they've agreed to withdraw the contempt charges,"" Denne said. 
Enron -- and two other companies that managed to quickly purge the charges against them -- had been found in contempt in late June after it refused to turn over documents, violating subpoenas that the committee issued on June 11. 
The subpoenas called for documents of all kinds, including those with specific details -- prices, quantities and capacity -- of the companies' transactions in the state's wholesale electricity market. 
Enron officials balked at the request, saying they didn't want to turn over documents that might include confidential trade secrets. 
Ultimately, the refusal to turn over documents brought the company perilously close to being found in contempt by the Senate. 
Thursday morning, the Senate Rules Committee met to consider the committee's contempt recommendation and whether it should be forwarded to the full Senate, along with suggested punishments in the form of fines. 
After an hour of finger-pointing and confusing allegations, Senate President Pro Tem John Burton sent the two sides into a conference room to work out their differences. 
At 6 p.m., Enron officials signed the same confidentiality agreement that several other companies have signed. 
Dunn said his committee will continue to meet throughout the fall and will inspect the documents that have been provided by energy companies. 
In addition, the committee awaits records from several municipal utilities, including the Sacramento Municipal Utility District. SMUD was among 11 municipal utilities that recently received subpoenas from the committee requesting documents.

Enron and state reach agreement on papers 
The power company avoids a contempt order for files on electricity market. 
September 14, 2001 
By KIMBERLY KINDY
The Orange County Register 
SACRAMENTO -- Enron Corp. signed a confidentiality agreement late Thursday that should allow for the release of thousands of documents to aid in a Senate investigation into the California electricity market. 
The compromise apparently ends six months of stalled negotiations. 
At stake for Enron was a move to hold the company in contempt and start assessing millions of dollars in fines. 
The Senate Rules Committee on Thursday morning had delayed for a day a vote to consider asking the full Senate to hold Enron in contempt because the company has not turned over the subpoenaed documents. 
While delaying the decision, Senate Leader John Burton, D-San Francisco, ordered attorneys from the Legislative Counsel of California, a Senate committee investigating electricity price gouging and Enron into a room to work out an agreement that would protect the security of confidential documents that contain trade secrets. 
""Let's hope cooler minds prevail,"" said Rules Committee member Sen. Ross Johnson, R-Irvine, as the committee members moved to a conference room for a daylong meeting. 
The contempt proceedings, for now, have been dropped, said Sen. Joe Dunn, D-Santa Ana, who chairs the Senate committee investigating price gouging and possible collusion in the electricity market. 
Enron officials did not return calls seeking comment on the agreement late Thursday. 
The state Senate today is also expected to consider a resolution that would order the nation's two largest public-employee pension funds to sell off stock of any company that is found in contempt by the Legislature. 
The Legislative Counsel of California is recommending the action. 
""It is not good public policy to hold stock in companies in contempt of the California Legislature and therefore in contempt of the people of California,"" said Dunn, who asked for the counsel's review and recommendation. 


Enron agrees to turn over documents to Senate investigators 
By Jennifer Coleman
ASSOCIATED PRESS 
September 13, 2001 
SACRAMENTO - Enron Corp. agreed Thursday to release company documents to a Senate committee investigating possible price manipulation, ending the committee's quest to cite the energy company for contempt for not complying with a subpoena. 
The Senate Rules Committee heard arguments from Enron and the Senate Select Committee to Investigate Price Manipulation of the Wholesale Energy Market over whether the energy company should be found in contempt. 
In June, the select committee subpoenaed Enron files as part of its investigation into record-high prices in the state's wholesale electricity market. Enron sued to quash the subpoena, a motion a judge rejected. 
The judge agreed, however, that Enron was entitled to a protective order for documents revealing sensitive trading and financial information. 
Sen. Joe Dunn, D-Santa Ana, chairman of the select committee, said late Thursday that Enron agreed to the same confidentiality agreement accepted by several other generators. With that agreement, Dunn said, the committee would withdraw a report that recommended Enron be found in contempt. 
He said he expects documents to be transferred immediately. 
Dunn had argued the subpoena also covered nonconfidential documents, and since the energy company also refused to release those papers to the committee, it was in contempt. 
He asked Sen. John Burton, D-San Francisco, chairman of the rules committee, to approve fines against Enron for each day they didn't comply with the subpoena. The daily fines would start at $1,000, doubling each day for 10 days. Then the company would be fined $1 million a day. 
Enron lawyer Michael Kirby said the company had put 49,000 nonconfidential documents in a depository in Sacramento so committee investigators could review them. 
But Dennis Murphy, a lawyer for the select committee, said Enron didn't tell investigators where the depository was located. The committee discovered the address in documents filed by Enron for the court case, he said. 
""We've been trying to get into the depository for a week. They have not allowed our people in there to verify what documents are in there,"" he said. 
Kirby disputed that, and blamed the committee for delays in turning over the balance of the documents. The two parties haven't met since the judge ordered the protective order, and Kirby said it was the committee that refused to work out the order's details. 
Dunn said the law requires Enron to produce the documents before it was entitled to a protective order. 
Sen. Ross Johnson, R-Irvine, said Dunn's push to have Enron found in contempt ""smacks at this point of Enron being punished for exercising their right to go to court."" 
A contempt report on Reliant Energy has also been sent to the Senate. A contempt finding against Mirant Corp. was later reversed when the company opened a document depository in Sacramento for the committee's investigators. 
If the full Senate imposes sanctions against Reliant or Enron, it will be the first time since 1929, when the Senate voted to jail reluctant witnesses during a committee investigation of price fixing and price gouging involving cement sales to the state.",99,1797

On the other hand a delay in this proceeding is probably in our interest, in view of the SCE Counterclaim.  Going this route would probably be in lieu of some of the other alternatives we discussed, so I believe we will need to get senior management't approval to any agreement.",36,277

Enron agrees to provide files, averts Senate contempt finding 
By Emily Bazar
Bee Capitol Bureau
(Published Sept. 14, 2001) 
State lawmakers moved to drop contempt charges against Enron Corp. on Thursday after the energy marketer agreed to begin turning over thousands of pages of documents immediately. 
The last-minute wrangling between Enron and a special Senate committee investigating energy price manipulation essentially brought to an end a series of extraordinary legislative proceedings that were last invoked in 1929. 
Following hours of closed-door meetings, Enron signed an agreement in the early evening, allowing it to dodge an impending contempt finding by the full Senate and the possibility of stiff fines. 
Under the deal, Enron will begin sharing records with the committee in exchange for a confidentiality agreement intended to protect its most sensitive documents after they are turned over. 
""It took too long to bring this to resolution,"" said state Sen. Joe Dunn, D-Santa Ana, who chairs the committee. ""I can't help but think it had to do with the pending sanctions for contempt."" 
As part of the deal, however, Enron did not agree to drop the lawsuit it filed in July asking the court to intervene on its behalf, said spokeswoman Karen Denne. She said the company is still considering its options. 
""We're pleased they've agreed to withdraw the contempt charges,"" Denne said. 
Enron -- and two other companies that managed to quickly purge the charges against them -- had been found in contempt in late June after it refused to turn over documents, violating subpoenas that the committee issued on June 11. 
The subpoenas called for documents of all kinds, including those with specific details -- prices, quantities and capacity -- of the companies' transactions in the state's wholesale electricity market. 
Enron officials balked at the request, saying they didn't want to turn over documents that might include confidential trade secrets. 
Ultimately, the refusal to turn over documents brought the company perilously close to being found in contempt by the Senate. 
Thursday morning, the Senate Rules Committee met to consider the committee's contempt recommendation and whether it should be forwarded to the full Senate, along with suggested punishments in the form of fines. 
After an hour of finger-pointing and confusing allegations, Senate President Pro Tem John Burton sent the two sides into a conference room to work out their differences. 
At 6 p.m., Enron officials signed the same confidentiality agreement that several other companies have signed. 
Dunn said his committee will continue to meet throughout the fall and will inspect the documents that have been provided by energy companies. 
In addition, the committee awaits records from several municipal utilities, including the Sacramento Municipal Utility District. SMUD was among 11 municipal utilities that recently received subpoenas from the committee requesting documents.

Enron and state reach agreement on papers 
The power company avoids a contempt order for files on electricity market. 
September 14, 2001 
By KIMBERLY KINDY
The Orange County Register 
SACRAMENTO -- Enron Corp. signed a confidentiality agreement late Thursday that should allow for the release of thousands of documents to aid in a Senate investigation into the California electricity market. 
The compromise apparently ends six months of stalled negotiations. 
At stake for Enron was a move to hold the company in contempt and start assessing millions of dollars in fines. 
The Senate Rules Committee on Thursday morning had delayed for a day a vote to consider asking the full Senate to hold Enron in contempt because the company has not turned over the subpoenaed documents. 
While delaying the decision, Senate Leader John Burton, D-San Francisco, ordered attorneys from the Legislative Counsel of California, a Senate committee investigating electricity price gouging and Enron into a room to work out an agreement that would protect the security of confidential documents that contain trade secrets. 
""Let's hope cooler minds prevail,"" said Rules Committee member Sen. Ross Johnson, R-Irvine, as the committee members moved to a conference room for a daylong meeting. 
The contempt proceedings, for now, have been dropped, said Sen. Joe Dunn, D-Santa Ana, who chairs the Senate committee investigating price gouging and possible collusion in the electricity market. 
Enron officials did not return calls seeking comment on the agreement late Thursday. 
The state Senate today is also expected to consider a resolution that would order the nation's two largest public-employee pension funds to sell off stock of any company that is found in contempt by the Legislature. 
The Legislative Counsel of California is recommending the action. 
""It is not good public policy to hold stock in companies in contempt of the California Legislature and therefore in contempt of the people of California,"" said Dunn, who asked for the counsel's review and recommendation. 


Enron agrees to turn over documents to Senate investigators 
By Jennifer Coleman
ASSOCIATED PRESS 
September 13, 2001 
SACRAMENTO - Enron Corp. agreed Thursday to release company documents to a Senate committee investigating possible price manipulation, ending the committee's quest to cite the energy company for contempt for not complying with a subpoena. 
The Senate Rules Committee heard arguments from Enron and the Senate Select Committee to Investigate Price Manipulation of the Wholesale Energy Market over whether the energy company should be found in contempt. 
In June, the select committee subpoenaed Enron files as part of its investigation into record-high prices in the state's wholesale electricity market. Enron sued to quash the subpoena, a motion a judge rejected. 
The judge agreed, however, that Enron was entitled to a protective order for documents revealing sensitive trading and financial information. 
Sen. Joe Dunn, D-Santa Ana, chairman of the select committee, said late Thursday that Enron agreed to the same confidentiality agreement accepted by several other generators. With that agreement, Dunn said, the committee would withdraw a report that recommended Enron be found in contempt. 
He said he expects documents to be transferred immediately. 
Dunn had argued the subpoena also covered nonconfidential documents, and since the energy company also refused to release those papers to the committee, it was in contempt. 
He asked Sen. John Burton, D-San Francisco, chairman of the rules committee, to approve fines against Enron for each day they didn't comply with the subpoena. The daily fines would start at $1,000, doubling each day for 10 days. Then the company would be fined $1 million a day. 
Enron lawyer Michael Kirby said the company had put 49,000 nonconfidential documents in a depository in Sacramento so committee investigators could review them. 
But Dennis Murphy, a lawyer for the select committee, said Enron didn't tell investigators where the depository was located. The committee discovered the address in documents filed by Enron for the court case, he said. 
""We've been trying to get into the depository for a week. They have not allowed our people in there to verify what documents are in there,"" he said. 
Kirby disputed that, and blamed the committee for delays in turning over the balance of the documents. The two parties haven't met since the judge ordered the protective order, and Kirby said it was the committee that refused to work out the order's details. 
Dunn said the law requires Enron to produce the documents before it was entitled to a protective order. 
Sen. Ross Johnson, R-Irvine, said Dunn's push to have Enron found in contempt ""smacks at this point of Enron being punished for exercising their right to go to court."" 
A contempt report on Reliant Energy has also been sent to the Senate. A contempt finding against Mirant Corp. was later reversed when the company opened a document depository in Sacramento for the committee's investigators. 
If the full Senate imposes sanctions against Reliant or Enron, it will be the first time since 1929, when the Senate voted to jail reluctant witnesses during a committee investigation of price fixing and price gouging involving cement sales to the state.",45,2201

Subject:	Commission Clarifies DA Suspension Decision--Requires Utilities to Accept DASRs for Facility Adds Under Contracts Signed Before 10.20.01

?	In response to the Commission's suspension of DA, numerous market participants--including Enron--filed ""Petitions for Rehearing.""
?	The California PUC has issued a decision denying the petitions.
?	Many of those participants are likely to file for appellate court review of the Commission's denial.
?	In its decision denying the Petitions, the Commission did however modify its initial decision in several respects.
?	Key among those is a modification regarding facility adds.  
?	Those comments refer to the ability to continue to submit DASRs for new facilities under contracts signed prior to September 20th that provide for facility adds.
?	The Commission agreed and has ordered the utilities to accept DASRs for facility adds under contract terms executed prior to 10.20.01.  The precise language is cited below.
?	If you would like a copy of the decision, please contact Joseph Alamo.

Best,
Jeff

""We reaffirm that for the time being, and unless the Commission states otherwise in a subsequent decision, utilities are required to process DASRs relating to contracts or agreements that were executed on or before September 20th, 2001, including DASRs for service to new facilities or accounts if the underlying contract pursuant to which those DASRs are submitted allowed for the provision of that additional service.  Thus, for example, with respect to the specific ESP contract described by UC/CSU in their rehearing application, the utilities are required to accept, even after September 20, 2001, any DASRs they receive that legitimatley relate to that contract...[W]e want to make it clear that...utilities cannot set a deadline after which they could refuse to process DASRs relating to contracts executed on or before September 20, 2001.""  pp 20-21",47,830

As requested, Mark Baldwin has put together a summary of the Proposed Decision and Comment Points for filing on Friday.  Below are his comments which we can use for discussion purposes at the conference call later this morning.  Having reviewed the Proposed Decision I would agree with Mark's assessment in that while we may prefer that the Commission not modify the Comprehensive Settlement, overall the modifications made should not negatively impact Transwestern.  The Proposed Decision retains two important aspects of the CS for Transwestern:  1)  Unbundling of the SoCal backbone transmission system and receipt point capacity and 2) Retention of primary firm RP capacity of 750MM/d at Needles from Transwestern.  gh

Subject:	Bilas , Proposed Decision SoCal GIR

Glen,

I have reviewed the 10/10/01 Revised PD of Comr. Bilas as requested. In view
of the entirety of TW's interest ,I still ascertain that TW can support the
current 10/10 PD. Noted below for your information and review is a summary
of the Modifications to the CSA that Bilas is currently offering :


1)Market concentration limits reduced from 40% to 30 % of available receipt
point capacity. TW has preferred no limits to market concentration
historically. However, as before, I do not believe pushing this issue will
be successful or productive for TW. There are no market concentration limits
in the secondary market. (Although Bilas warns market participants that any
misbehavior will be subject to CPUC investigation) P.44

2)SoCal will be required to make available on a daily basis any unutilized
firm RP capacity. I don't see any negative impact on TW, perhaps positive.
P.45

3)Price Cap for secondary intrastate market set at 120 % of SoCal firm rate.
This is the same cap that applies to SoCal. I don't like the precedent set
in this area, however it assures that the economic value allocation between
SoCal citygate and supply basin will proportionately tend toward the
interstate system providers in any tight transport/supply scenario. P.46

4)Not really a change , but Bilas mentions support for Hector Rd. as a
delivery/receipt at Ferc.

5)PD does not reduce the core's interstate capacity nor their storage
capacities but rather maintains these capacities at current levels. Current
level 1044 MMcfd, proposed 1000 MMcfd on the interstate system and current
storage 70 BCF, 327 MMcfd of injection and 1,935 MMcfd withdrawal Vs
proposed 55 BCF.  I see no clear negative impact on TW from this change.P.
52 &54.

6) CTA's (Core Transport Agents) allowed to reject only their prorata share
of non-reliability storage service. No impact on TW interests. P. 58

7) SoCal directed to present(via Advice Ltr.) how the cost of noncore
default balancing will be allocated ONLY to those noncore customer using
this service and not to the Core customers. I see no impact on TW. P.62

8)PD rejects the requirement that SoCal/SDG&E file an application with a
proposal to address core procurement function as the default provider.  I
see only positive attributes of this change for TW. P.63

9)Preserves the right for SoCal/SDG&E to seek recovery of expenditures
associated with the transfers of customers from Core to Core Aggregator. NO
impact on TW. P.66

10)PD orders a 10 % cap on ITCS (stranded cost)responsibility borne by
bundled core customers due to unbundled core interstate capacity. No direct
impact upon TW interest, however, likely a touchy point with noncore
interest. P. 75

11) PD orders that the core contribution to noncore ITCS will end effective
the adoption of the PD. Additionally, noncore customers to pay 50% of core
ITCS till the end of the core TW and EPNG agreements. No negative impact on
TW. Noncore customers bear additional expense. The PD estimates an
additional $18 million over next 5 to 6 years. P. 78 The PD provides an
estimate of increased stranded cost for the noncore between 01 and 06 to be
approx. $ 44.4 Million.

12) PD say NO to an increase in the core brokerage fee of $ 0.0039 (to $2.4
cents). No impact on TW interest. P.83.

13) PD treats Core Subscription service differently on an accounting basis.
No impact on TW. P.85-87

14)Generally, the PD makes some administrative changes to the small core/ESP
market rules and SoCal services and consumer protection implementation . NO
impact on TW interest. P 88-100.

15)Lots of tweaking on how SoCal can recover the cost to implement to
services envisioned under the CSA. Owing to the fact that SoCal has already
started to ""implement"" portions of the CSA and those cost are accruing to a
balancing account etc. Bottomline, not consequential to the approval of the
PD. No direct impact upon TW interest. P. 103-110.


On whole the centerpiece of TW's interest in this proceeding remains intact.
The SoCal receipt points are unbundled along with ""SoCal backbone
facilities"". TW has primary firm RP of no less than 750 mmfcd. Mojave is
recognized at only 50 mmfcd firm RP. No receipt point complex is given a
preference for capacity expansion. Line 235 appears to remain useful for TW
deliveries into the market load centers. The PD modifications to the CSA do
not impose upon TW any conditions or costs that would be reason not to
support the PD. The parties most affected by the PD are the core aggregators
with additional costs and restrictions to service options and noncore
customers with additional cost allocations.


Points for comments

1) TW agrees with the PD that the centerpiece of positive changes embodied
in the CSA in the creation of firm tradable RP rights. This change in SoCal
market structure provides all market participants with the proper tools to
build long term supply and transportation contracts.

2) Further adoption of the PD substantially reduces unnecessary market
inefficiencies at the California border by providing all market participants
with gas scheduling certainty.

3) The creation of tradable secondary rights on SoCal's intrastate system
will promote competition and generally lead to stable delivered gas prices.

4) The PD correctly observes that the PG&E market structure which relieves
upon an unbundled intrastate backbone system work ""relatively well"" during
California's challenging energy markets.

5)TW agrees that the time is ripe for approval of the PD. The energy markets
in California have been improving and stabilizing. The Commission promising
options are still valid in today's gas market. Further, SoCal is already
starting to follow the CSA game plan in their attempts to improve the
operating environment on the SoCal system. It is consistent to follow
through and make the structural changes required to make permanent these
improvements.

6)TW supports SoCal and others whom are approving this PD. (ON THIS POINT,
TW SHOULD BE SURE THAT SOCAL IS ON BOARD AS WELL AS OTHER CSA SIGNATORIES,
PRIOR TO FILING THESE TYPE COMMENTS)


I look forward to discussing these matters tomorrow on the conference call.

Folks,
to clarify...

1) The recurring call-in number for this weekly call has already been established, which is as follows 
	(same as last week):

Here's the suggested plan to try to make our weekly calls as efficient, painless and useful as possible.  All other ideas, thoughts, comments, etc., are welcome.

We'll set up a recurring call-in number (for Thursday's at 8:30 AM, i.e., same number every week)
It will be assumed that everyone will call in; no pre-meeting prep necessary.
If someone doesn't call in, it will be assumed that the person has a conflict and can't make it (giving the benefit of the doubt is a virtue).
Those that do call in will conduct the call.  (Again, the assumption is that, save for minor exceptions, everyone will be on the call.)

Thoughts?

I asked PP if she was interested in going to Honduras between xmas and new
years this year.  I really need to get certified for diving and the diving
there is extremely cheap, but reliable (its an American outfit and all
PADI).  PP thought she might be interested in going and doing it with me.
So, first I wanted to know what you thought of the whole thing.  Then, if
you are into it at all I will look into flight opportunities (staying down
there and the scuba course and single dives are all very cheap, but the
flight would be the most expensive).  And, last, do you have miles on
continental and are they miles that PP can take advantage of also?  I think
Continental goes to San Salvador which is a common connecting city.  So, you
might luck out on flight costs and the whole trip would not be too bad.
What do you think?

The Proposed Decision retains two important aspects of the CS for Transwestern:  1)  Unbundling of the SoCal backbone transmission system and receipt point capacity and 2) Retention of primary firm RP capacity of 750MM/d at Needles from Transwestern.  gh

Subject:	Bilas , Proposed Decision SoCal GIR

Glen,

I have reviewed the 10/10/01 Revised PD of Comr. Bilas as requested. In view
of the entirety of TW's interest ,I still ascertain that TW can support the
current 10/10 PD. Noted below for your information and review is a summary
of the Modifications to the CSA that Bilas is currently offering :


1)Market concentration limits reduced from 40% to 30 % of available receipt
point capacity. TW has preferred no limits to market concentration
historically. However, as before, I do not believe pushing this issue will
be successful or productive for TW. There are no market concentration limits
in the secondary market. (Although Bilas warns market participants that any
misbehavior will be subject to CPUC investigation) P.44

2)SoCal will be required to make available on a daily basis any unutilized
firm RP capacity. I don't see any negative impact on TW, perhaps positive.
P.45

3)Price Cap for secondary intrastate market set at 120 % of SoCal firm rate.
This is the same cap that applies to SoCal. I don't like the precedent set
in this area, however it assures that the economic value allocation between
SoCal citygate and supply basin will proportionately tend toward the
interstate system providers in any tight transport/supply scenario. P.46

4)Not really a change , but Bilas mentions support for Hector Rd. as a
delivery/receipt at Ferc.

5)PD does not reduce the core's interstate capacity nor their storage
capacities but rather maintains these capacities at current levels. Current
level 1044 MMcfd, proposed 1000 MMcfd on the interstate system and current
storage 70 BCF, 327 MMcfd of injection and 1,935 MMcfd withdrawal Vs
proposed 55 BCF.  I see no clear negative impact on TW from this change.P.
52 &54.

6) CTA's (Core Transport Agents) allowed to reject only their prorata share
of non-reliability storage service. No impact on TW interests. P. 58

7) SoCal directed to present(via Advice Ltr.) how the cost of noncore
default balancing will be allocated ONLY to those noncore customer using
this service and not to the Core customers. I see no impact on TW. P.62

8)PD rejects the requirement that SoCal/SDG&E file an application with a
proposal to address core procurement function as the default provider.  I
see only positive attributes of this change for TW. P.63

9)Preserves the right for SoCal/SDG&E to seek recovery of expenditures
associated with the transfers of customers from Core to Core Aggregator. NO
impact on TW. P.66

10)PD orders a 10 % cap on ITCS (stranded cost)responsibility borne by
bundled core customers due to unbundled core interstate capacity. No direct
impact upon TW interest, however, likely a touchy point with noncore
interest. P. 75

11) PD orders that the core contribution to noncore ITCS will end effective
the adoption of the PD. Additionally, noncore customers to pay 50% of core
ITCS till the end of the core TW and EPNG agreements. No negative impact on
TW. Noncore customers bear additional expense. The PD estimates an
additional $18 million over next 5 to 6 years. P. 78 The PD provides an
estimate of increased stranded cost for the noncore between 01 and 06 to be
approx. $ 44.4 Million.

12) PD say NO to an increase in the core brokerage fee of $ 0.0039 (to $2.4
cents). No impact on TW interest. P.83.

13) PD treats Core Subscription service differently on an accounting basis.
No impact on TW. P.85-87

14)Generally, the PD makes some administrative changes to the small core/ESP
market rules and SoCal services and consumer protection implementation . NO
impact on TW interest. P 88-100.

15)Lots of tweaking on how SoCal can recover the cost to implement to
services envisioned under the CSA. Owing to the fact that SoCal has already
started to ""implement"" portions of the CSA and those cost are accruing to a
balancing account etc. Bottomline, not consequential to the approval of the
PD. No direct impact upon TW interest. P. 103-110.


On whole the centerpiece of TW's interest in this proceeding remains intact.
The SoCal receipt points are unbundled along with ""SoCal backbone
facilities"". TW has primary firm RP of no less than 750 mmfcd. Mojave is
recognized at only 50 mmfcd firm RP. No receipt point complex is given a
preference for capacity expansion. Line 235 appears to remain useful for TW
deliveries into the market load centers. The PD modifications to the CSA do
not impose upon TW any conditions or costs that would be reason not to
support the PD. The parties most affected by the PD are the core aggregators
with additional costs and restrictions to service options and noncore
customers with additional cost allocations.


Points for comments

1) TW agrees with the PD that the centerpiece of positive changes embodied
in the CSA in the creation of firm tradable RP rights. This change in SoCal
market structure provides all market participants with the proper tools to
build long term supply and transportation contracts.

2) Further adoption of the PD substantially reduces unnecessary market
inefficiencies at the California border by providing all market participants
with gas scheduling certainty.

3) The creation of tradable secondary rights on SoCal's intrastate system
will promote competition and generally lead to stable delivered gas prices.

4) The PD correctly observes that the PG&E market structure which relieves
upon an unbundled intrastate backbone system work ""relatively well"" during
California's challenging energy markets.

5)TW agrees that the time is ripe for approval of the PD. The energy markets
in California have been improving and stabilizing. The Commission promising
options are still valid in today's gas market. Further, SoCal is already
starting to follow the CSA game plan in their attempts to improve the
operating environment on the SoCal system. It is consistent to follow
through and make the structural changes required to make permanent these
improvements.

6)TW supports SoCal and others whom are approving this PD. (ON THIS POINT,
TW SHOULD BE SURE THAT SOCAL IS ON BOARD AS WELL AS OTHER CSA SIGNATORIES,
PRIOR TO FILING THESE TYPE COMMENTS)


I look forward to discussing these matters tomorrow on the conference call.

Customers going DA must first clear any payables to DWR for power previously consumed but not full paid for.
Customers going DA must pay for DWR's stranded power costs caused by the customer leaving, UNLESS DWR has a net short position, in which case there would be no stranded costs and therefore no fees.
The bill allows customers to file a complaint with the PUC regarding DWR's claims of stranded costs.
Customers who choose green DA power (defined as 80% renewable) will be exempt from stranded cost fees so long as green DA load does not exceed DWR's net short position.",,203,0

FYI.  Note below that even the mighty and powerful Power Authority's own
crackerjack analysis asserts that there is still a net short (despite
DWR contracts and DA ""stampede""), which should leave one to believe
that, contrary to Angelides' letter, the more the DA the better. Which
further supports Loretta Lynch's response to the Angelides' letter that
DA reduces the amount of spot power DWR has to buy.
Best,
Jeff
CONSUMER POWER AND CONSERVATION FINANCING AUTHORITY 
Pace of Power Authority Renewable Portfolio Agenda is Slowed 
Quite possibly the most significant action taken at the October 19
Consumer Power and Conservation Financing Authority (Power Authority)
was its inaction on contracts proposed for approval. The Power Authority
has aggressively pursued a broad renewable portfolio, with the intent to
approve contracts as soon as possible. 
Instead of approving a number of contracts on its October 19 agenda, the
Power Authority deferred calendared decisions on request for bids until
its November 2 meeting, acknowledging that no action can be taken until
the Department of Water Resources (DWR) rate agreement stalemate has
been resolved. 
Chairman Freeman stated that the Public Utility Commission's rejection
of the rate agreement has created an obstacle for the Power Authority to
exercise renewable contracts, to contract for peaker generation and/or
to implement demand side programs. The Power Authority relies upon DWR's
credit to fund these programs, and until a rate agreement is finalized
the Power Authority cannot sign contracts. 
Freeman indicated that the Power Authority has signed letters of intent
to purchase output from 14 biomass facilities in the Central Valley, as
well as 400 MW generated by wind. 
With the Current Glut of Contracts, Why Do We Need Additional Reserves? 
Kellan Flukinger, Senior Advisor to Chairman Freeman and Laura Doll,
provided a detailed presentation explaining why he believes the Power
Authority must contract for additional renewable and peaking generation.
Flukinger believes that despite direct access and the current glut of
electricity supplied in long-term contracts, there still appears to be a
net short of a few thousand megawatts within the State. 
Flukinger concluded that the State still is at the mercy of electric
generators who are not subject to PUC regulatory authority and who have
no real obligation to build and maintain new facilities or to serve
customers within the State. He believes that the short-term contracts
and spot purchases leave the state vulnerable to price-spikes and supply
shortages. He believes that the reserve can be managed through
Time-of-Use and Real-Time-Pricing, conservation, interruptibles, demand
side management, renewables and peakers. 
Power Authority Names William Barry as Chief Financial Officer 
William Barry was approved as Chief Financial Officer of the Power
Authority at its October 19 Board meeting in Sacramento. Mr. Barry
currently works for the City of San Francisco, and has worked in the
past for the New York Power Authority.

Subject: RE: Angelides Oct. 19th Letter to L. Lynch Urging July 1 DA
Suspension Date


FYI.  Note below that even the mighty and powerful Power Authority's own
crackerjack analysis asserts that there is still a net short (despite
DWR contracts and DA ""stampede""), which should leave one to believe
that, contrary to Angelides' letter, the more the DA the better. Which
further supports Loretta Lynch's response to the Angelides' letter that
DA reduces the amount of spot power DWR has to buy.

CONSUMER POWER AND CONSERVATION FINANCING AUTHORITY
Pace of Power Authority Renewable Portfolio Agenda is Slowed
Quite possibly the most significant action taken at the October 19
Consumer Power and Conservation Financing Authority (Power Authority)
was its inaction on contracts proposed for approval. The Power Authority
has aggressively pursued a broad renewable portfolio, with the intent to
approve contracts as soon as possible.
Instead of approving a number of contracts on its October 19 agenda, the
Power Authority deferred calendared decisions on request for bids until
its November 2 meeting, acknowledging that no action can be taken until
the Department of Water Resources (DWR) rate agreement stalemate has
been resolved.
Chairman Freeman stated that the Public Utility Commission's rejection
of the rate agreement has created an obstacle for the Power Authority to
exercise renewable contracts, to contract for peaker generation and/or
to implement demand side programs. The Power Authority relies upon DWR's
credit to fund these programs, and until a rate agreement is finalized
the Power Authority cannot sign contracts.
Freeman indicated that the Power Authority has signed letters of intent
to purchase output from 14 biomass facilities in the Central Valley, as
well as 400 MW generated by wind.
With the Current Glut of Contracts, Why Do We Need Additional Reserves?
Kellan Flukinger, Senior Advisor to Chairman Freeman and Laura Doll,
provided a detailed presentation explaining why he believes the Power
Authority must contract for additional renewable and peaking generation.
Flukinger believes that despite direct access and the current glut of
electricity supplied in long-term contracts, there still appears to be a
net short of a few thousand megawatts within the State.
Flukinger concluded that the State still is at the mercy of electric
generators who are not subject to PUC regulatory authority and who have
no real obligation to build and maintain new facilities or to serve
customers within the State. He believes that the short-term contracts
and spot purchases leave the state vulnerable to price-spikes and supply
shortages. He believes that the reserve can be managed through
Time-of-Use and Real-Time-Pricing, conservation, interruptibles, demand
side management, renewables and peakers.
Power Authority Names William Barry as Chief Financial Officer
William Barry was approved as Chief Financial Officer of the Power
Authority at its October 19 Board meeting in Sacramento. Mr. Barry
currently works for the City of San Francisco, and has worked in the
past for the New York Power Authority.

I've since found out that Perfect's doing a pilot with EES--acting as

Republican assemblymember from the Sacramento area.
Was a member of the Sacramento muni utility district prior to going to the legislature.
Republican (minority) head of the assembly electricity oversight committee (the one that Rod Wright chairs).
Don't recall that he's ever seen a a pro-utility bill that he didn't like.
In fact, he sponsored some legislation just this past session that would have locked the utilities in to major parts of the gas industry, and specifically wold have locked out competition.  It was strongly opposed by industry and defeated.
When push came to shove, I can't think of a time he didn't side with the utilities.
Even when the Assembly Republicans were doing of good job of bottling up Davis' ridiculous bailout bills in Rod Wright's committee, Pescetti seemed to go along more to tweek the Democrats than to foster competition.
And even then, he followed; he didn't lead--other, more junior, members on the committee led.
Can't recall a time that he's been there for us.

I'd be happy to talk with him, but if we need someone at the Rick level to contact him, that's great, too.  Just let me know.

California Power Authority Taps SFPUC's Berry as New CFO
SAN FRANCISCO -- Bill Berry will soon leave his job with San Francisco's public utility commission to head up finances for California 's newly formed power authority, which is authorized to issue $5 billion in revenue bonds. 
The board of the California Consumer Power and Conservation Financing Authority on Friday selected Berry as its first chief financial officer. He will start in his new position in early November. 
The authority was established earlier this year as a result of the state's energy crisis, and is charged with promoting energy conservation efforts and increasing California 's capacity to generate electricity . 
Berry is currently the assistant general manager of finance and administration at the utility commission, which provides water and sewer services to the city and some neighboring counties, as well as hydroelectric power for San Francisco government operations. 
Berry has been at the SFPUC since 1999, overseeing finance, personnel and training, information technology, and customer service. He also helped develop the commission's long-range strategic plan and 10-year capital improvement program, which may eventually entail requests for voters to approve more than $4 billion in bonds. 
Berry worked for a start-up Internet company in Palo Alto from 1996 to 1998 before joining the commission. 
From 1985 to 1996, Berry was an investment banker at Lehman Brothers in San Francisco, specializing in financing municipal and state-owned power, water, and wastewater systems, according to a release from the power authority. 
He also managed debt financing, financial planning, investment portfolios, and investor relations while a vice president of corporate finance for the New York Power Authority from 1979 until 1985. He helped develop the authority's first conservation program. 
In his new postion as CFO, Berry will earn $185,000 annually.

It is my hope that you and your loved ones have not been directly
affected in the tragedy. 

I assume that the trip to Mendocino is still going forward. I am not
happy to report that my lower back has gotten worse and not better since
the accident in Hawaii. Sadly, I may have to pass on Mendocino. I will
find out more this upcoming week and let you know. 

If I do have to cancel I would assume we should keep the Grandma's room
for Jeff & Lu. If there are any potential cancellation charges I should
pay to Lari please let me know. I have been looking forward to this for
so long, I am sad to think of not joining all of you.

I will get back to you by Wednesday.

Hi Group,

Need input for Lari as our ride approaches (Pat can you forward to Lu
and
ask him to reply to me).

I know some of you have ridden with Lari many times, but her scheduler
is
facilitating this process and has asked for some information.  Please
provide the following and I will batch and send to Lari:


Years riding
How often currently riding
type of riding (i.e. English lessons, dressage, trail)
type of saddle preferred
age, height and weight


Also, we initially planned on an all-day ride on Sat, and a four-hour
ride
on Sunday so we could all head back relatively early.  Lari would like
to
know where we want to ride on each day.  Nora is only riding for the
four-hour ride, and prefers the beach.  How about an all-day ride in the
redwoods on Saturday, with a four-hour beach ride on Sunday?

Subject:	Conversation with Edison re: Getting Negative CTC Paid

I talked to John Fielder (SVP Edison) about setting up a meeting for Barry Tycholiz with Edison's CFO about hedging Edison's QF price risk. Fielder wanted to talk about the negative CTC issue. Here's what he said:

They plan to ""settle"" with the ESPs and pay them when they pay everyone else, which he re-iterated would be sometime in Q1'02.
Edison is holding firm to the notion that the negative CTC contributed to the utility's undercollection and that the ESP's share of the undercollection has to be netted against the payables attributable to the negative CTC and owed the ESP.
He said that they will propose to net it out in one of two ways:  1) lump sum netting (i.e., if they owe $50MM and the share of the undercollection is $30 MM, then they pay the ESP $20 MM; or 2) future reductions in PX Credit (i.e., they pay the ESP $50 MM, and then reduce the PX going forward until the $30 MM is paid down).  The numbers are illustrative only.
In addition, he said that they have the view that a decision is going to have to be made about 1) whether DA customers pay for stranded costs tied to the DWR L-T contracts, and 2) whether DA customers pay going forward for stranded costs tied to the QF contracts.  (Edison is clearly lobbying the PUC to get DA customers to pay for these costs.)
I recommended strongly that he de-link issues 1 and 2 above from the issue of paying us ASAP what they owe us for negative CTC.  He agreed.
He said that the PUC judge's recently issued pre-hearing conference order requires that Edison ""meet and confer"" with ESPs prior to the Nov. 7th hearing, and that Edison intends to set something up with ESPs prior to that hearing.
Fielder is also the point person on ""getting ESPs paid"" and intends to initiate settlement discussions with ESPs week after next.
It was very clear from the conversation that Edison is going to do everything possible (at the expense of creditors) to maximize headroom under the settlement it struck with the PUC a few weeks ago.  Edison's stalemate with the QFs is evidence of it.  We shouldn't assume anything different with the Negative CTC issue.

If you have any questions, let us know.

Wes,

If Edison sticks to their plan, they will want to meet before November 7th.  They are wanting to discuss completely different issues than PG&E   To date, PG&E issues have been focused around the outcome of the FERC refund case. I have worked through a couple of examples of this under collection issue with Jeff and we agree, Edison's  argument  that the DA load contributed to the under collection is ""technically"" correct.   We will have to work with Jeff to build a compelling argument that ESP's should not be required to continue to contribute to the under collection, especially as of March 31, 2002, the end of the rate freeze as required in AB 1890.   Somehow we have to convince ""the regulators""  that the original intent of the de-reg bill, that utilities recover what they can through no later than March, 02,  stay in place for the current DA load.  

Will keep you posted.

Subject:	Conversation with Edison re: Getting Negative CTC Paid

I talked to John Fielder (SVP Edison) about setting up a meeting for Barry Tycholiz with Edison's CFO about hedging Edison's QF price risk. Fielder wanted to talk about the negative CTC issue. Here's what he said:

They plan to ""settle"" with the ESPs and pay them when they pay everyone else, which he re-iterated would be sometime in Q1'02.
Edison is holding firm to the notion that the negative CTC contributed to the utility's undercollection and that the ESP's share of the undercollection has to be netted against the payables attributable to the negative CTC and owed the ESP.
He said that they will propose to net it out in one of two ways:  1) lump sum netting (i.e., if they owe $50MM and the share of the undercollection is $30 MM, then they pay the ESP $20 MM; or 2) future reductions in PX Credit (i.e., they pay the ESP $50 MM, and then reduce the PX going forward until the $30 MM is paid down).  The numbers are illustrative only.
In addition, he said that they have the view that a decision is going to have to be made about 1) whether DA customers pay for stranded costs tied to the DWR L-T contracts, and 2) whether DA customers pay going forward for stranded costs tied to the QF contracts.  (Edison is clearly lobbying the PUC to get DA customers to pay for these costs.)
I recommended strongly that he de-link issues 1 and 2 above from the issue of paying us ASAP what they owe us for negative CTC.  He agreed.
He said that the PUC judge's recently issued pre-hearing conference order requires that Edison ""meet and confer"" with ESPs prior to the Nov. 7th hearing, and that Edison intends to set something up with ESPs prior to that hearing.
Fielder is also the point person on ""getting ESPs paid"" and intends to initiate settlement discussions with ESPs week after next.
It was very clear from the conversation that Edison is going to do everything possible (at the expense of creditors) to maximize headroom under the settlement it struck with the PUC a few weeks ago.  Edison's stalemate with the QFs is evidence of it.  We shouldn't assume anything different with the Negative CTC issue.

Jeff,

Do we know how much Edison's total under collection is?  Would it be as simple as to determine their total (around $3 billion?) and  gross receivable (before any payments - 145 million) and calculate the % (around 5%)?  This would result in a pretty small percentage.  Another way to look at it would be on a % of load basis.  If you use the DA load information Sue forwarded to us on October 1st,   this % (5.7%)  would also be very small.  How do you think they will look at it?  I think we would all agree to a 5% haircut, if they would JUST PAY US!

Question:  I don't know what our book looks like on this issue, but if we were to take the ""netting"" through a reduction in the PX credit going forward, how much of a hit would that be, particularly if we were to get the $120 MM up front?

He said that they will propose to net it out in one of two ways:  1) lump sum netting (i.e., if they owe $50MM and the share of the undercollection is $30 MM, then they pay the ESP $20 MM; or 2) future reductions in PX Credit (i.e., they pay the ESP $50 MM, and then reduce the PX going forward until the $30 MM is paid down).  The numbers are illustrative only.
In addition, he said that they have the view that a decision is going to have to be made about 1) whether DA customers pay for stranded costs tied to the DWR L-T contracts, and 2) whether DA customers pay going forward for stranded costs tied to the QF contracts.  (Edison is clearly lobbying the PUC to get DA customers to pay for these costs.)
I recommended strongly that he de-link issues 1 and 2 above from the issue of paying us ASAP what they owe us for negative CTC.  He agreed.
He said that the PUC judge's recently issued pre-hearing conference order requires that Edison ""meet and confer"" with ESPs prior to the Nov. 7th hearing, and that Edison intends to set something up with ESPs prior to that hearing.
Fielder is also the point person on ""getting ESPs paid"" and intends to initiate settlement discussions with ESPs week after next.
It was very clear from the conversation that Edison is going to do everything possible (at the expense of creditors) to maximize headroom under the settlement it struck with the PUC a few weeks ago.  Edison's stalemate with the QFs is evidence of it.  We shouldn't assume anything different with the Negative CTC issue.

If you have any questions, let us know.

LOS ANGELES -(Dow Jones)- The California agency buying power in lieu of the state's ailing utilities resold electricity in the spot market during the second quarter at an average price of $45 a megawatt-hour, the agency said Wednesday. 

The announcement by the California Department of Water Resources was an answer to critics who blasted the department this summer for having to resell surplus power for as little as $1 a megawatt-hour because it secured too much electricity under long-term contracts negotiated by the administration of Gov. Gray Davis, the department said. 

In a press release, the department's California Energy Resources Scheduling division, its power-marketing arm, said it resold 224,871 megawatt-hours, or 1.1% of its total purchases. That power generally was first bought on the spot market or through monthly or quarterly contracts, not the long-term contracts, the department said. 

Such sales are typical of any power-buying operation, as demand for electricity can vary in unpredictable ways, the department said. 

The DWR is responsible for buying all the power needed by the customers of the state's three main utilities beyond what the utilities generate themselves or have secured under their own long-term contracts - or about one-third of the total. 

According to the DWR, power secured under Davis' long-term contracts covers one-third to one-half of the electricity it must supply. Short-term deals, such as monthly or quarterly contracts, represent one-third of the portfolio. The rest is bought in the spot market. 

The state has put its average cost of power under the long-term contracts at 7.9 cents per kilowatt-hour for the first five years and 6.9 cents per kilowatt-hour for the next five years. 

Davis has taken heat for locking up too much electricity at high prices. Similarly, the Department of Water Resources has been criticized for amateurish purchasing practices. 

The DWR releases information on its power transactions quarterly to protect its negotiating position, the department said. 

The DWR buys power for customers of PG&E Corp. (PCG) unit Pacific Gas & Electric, Edison International (EIX) unit Southern California Edison and Sempra Energy (SRE) unit San Diego Gas & Electric.",,512,0

Dear Friends,
=20
Today, a very delicate and beautiful bouquet of flowers was delivered to me=
 from Enron Government Affairs.  It is a bouquet of blooming orchids, purpl=
e hydrangia, pink roses and one yellow rose.  It is a delicate and beautifu=
l arrangement of flowers that remind me of my relationship with Jude Moussa=
.
=20
Jude was an emissions broker for Cantor Fitzgerald and worked on the 104th =
floor of the North Tower at the World Trade Center.  Jude and I met last Ap=
ril while I was working at Enron Global Markets.  In addition to sharing so=
me wonderful times together in Houston and New York City, we talked often. =
 Last Friday morning, Jude called me to say hello - one last time. =20
=20
My friend was a kind and considerate man with a gentle heart.  The irony of=
 his life is that he and his family fled Lebanon in the eighties to escape =
the war there. =20
=20
Jude's world is now a world of eternal love and peace.  And his spirit will=
 be kept alive by the memories that his family and friends share with each =
other, and with those of you who didn't have the joy of knowing him persona=
lly.
=20
Your flowers, your comforting words, and your friendship have eased my sadn=
ess these past few days.  Since yesterday, I have been in contact with Jude=
's family and I have relayed to them the outpouring of prayers and sympathy=
 that are directed at their son and the other victims of this terrible trag=
edy.

Setting aside my grief, I hope that your own sorrow and loss are eased in t=
he presence of family and friends. =20

Also, Sue and I discussed, and we can't see any reason why we wouldn't want very long, very dragged out hearings on this.  The longer the issue drags on, the more exposed DWR will be, the greater the likelihood of DWR contract negotiation, and the tougher it will be to drag the suspension date back to July 1.  In addition, hearings would (finally) force DWR to answer some questions---this time under oath, and possibly with the press present, which would be very beneficial--I'm talking to other folks to try to get Loretta make that happen.  Either of you see any reason why we wouldn't want to have hearings?

I took the plunge and got LASIK about a month ago. 
Amazing to be without glasses or contacts for the
first time in 20 years.  VERY convenient.  

Although some people tell me they miss the specs on
me.

In line with your letter, and in response to Wood's questionnaire about rolling the suspension date back to July 1, don't you think it is absolutely necessary to have hearings in order to establish a record prior to any decision?

Shouldn't DWR and its rev. req. be thoroughly scrutinized in the hearing room before making a decision.

Thanks for getting people together. There are (at least) 3 things going on here:

1) Coordinate PG&E/SCE
2) Edison ""meet and confer"" (on Monday?  sez Williams) to discuss the prehearing conference at the PUC on Nov. 7th.
3) Edison meeting to discuss settlement of PX credit that Fielder's coordinating.

2 and 3 are, of course, extremely related.  It is critical that gov't affairs (you or me or both) be completely involved in items 2 and 3 above, and frankly, i think that one of us needs to be at the meeting.  No finger pointing, but our litigation strategy with edison thus far has been wanting.

Subject: Status of CPUC Proposed Decisions on Direct Access Suspension


Jeff:

At your request I am offering this memo to explain the status of the agenda
items before the CPUC on the issue of suspension of the direct access
program.  There are two pending draft decisions at this time, the first is
the proposed decision of ALJ Barnett (Item H-7 on the last agenda) which was
modified by a changed version submitted by Pres. Lynch at 2:45 pm on 9-5-01,
the day before the last meeting.  This version indicated that direct access
was suspended as of the date of the order (which would have been Sept. 6)
and states in another ordering paragraph that the utilities are to advise
their customers that the suspension is effective Sept. 6, 2001, specifically
naming that date.  This order would have been interpreted to suspend direct
access as of Sept. 6 if it had been voted out that day.  The other item,
Agenda Item H-7A on the last agenda, is the Bilas alternate decision which
calls for hearings to determine the impact of direct access on the issuance
of bonds, and does not suspend direct access at this time.

Please be advised that the suspension date contained in H-7 can and probably
will be changed before the orders are considered at the CPUC meeting on
Sept. 20.  Either the Sept 6 date will be changed to the 20th of Sept., or
some other specific date could be inserted at all the locations in the order
dealing with the suspension date.  All that is required to make this change
is the distribution of a changed page on the Escutia table before the
Commission meeting.  Thus, it is important for all direct access supporters
to continue to urge the Commission, especially Commissioner Brown, to
support a suspension date later than Sept. 6, because it is so easy for the
date to be altered under Commission procedures.

Please let me know if you require any additional information on this
subject.

In conjunction with the issue paying ESPs past due PX amounts, Edison has affirmed that it will be making a proposal regarding how it wants to calculate the PX credit going forward.
It remains unclear whether Edison will try to fold controversial issues into negotiations on getting paid past due PX credit amounts(e.g., PX credit contributed to undercollection and therefore DA customers should help pay down the undercollection; DA customers must pay for stranded DWR contracts, etc.).  
So while Edison is making good noises about wanting to settle (which is a certainly a step in the right direction), it's still unclear whether they intend to attach terms to the deal that make the whole thing a nonstarter.
Got a call into John Fielder to try to get answers to some of these questions.
Will report back when (and if) we get some answers.

 not needed until mid August","Thanks, Sue.  FYI--this new schedule was discussed a lot last week, and apparently was a big part of the meeting that occured with Davis' people and Angelides last Thursday nite.  It was a move to buy time to try and get a comprehensive settlement in place in the legislature (i.e., core/noncore). 

In addition to buying time to save Direct Access, it also gives Angelides more time to get the bonds lined up, which seems to be an increasingly challenging task---there's growing speculation that the issuance will be much more difficult than Angelides has thus far let on. 

That said, I need to check around, but there is some chance that the plan/agreement is that the PUC decisions would go out well in advance of August (with effective date being August), which would then provide enough time to let the expedited ""appeals process"" under (SB37?) run its course in time for the issuance in Sept/Oct.  In short, we'll need to remain vigilant energized because there's a chance that the decisions to which Angelides refers in the memo could be up at the Commission sooner rather than later.  This is what I was hearing last Friday, but perhaps things have changed and now there's more time.   I'll check and report back.

Finally, simultaneous with those actions, folks are supposed to be putting the core/noncore agreement into legislative language.  I'll report back as soon as I have more information on that.

The memo to investors says that a new law will take effect on Aug 13 that puts in place shortened appeal times at the CPUC.  The memo says that the CPUC does not need to act on the key issues, including suspension of DA, until Aug 13 or later.  It also says the bonds are now to be sold in Sept-Oct.

Hedy, Scott, Bev -  the language currently says the bond surcharge will apply ""to all electric power delivered in California by electric corporations ...""  I know this is a longshot, but is there any chance of having this amended to either 

1) exclude volumes under DA contracts as of the effective date of this act, or 
2) more generally leave it to the PUC to adjust the surcharge for customer classes based on their contribution - or lack thereof - to DWR's purchasing requirements.

The justification for this exemption is grounded in excluding customers who have not caused the DWR problem; e.g. large San Diego customers or PGE/SCE customers who have been DA  the last couple years or parts thereof.  (We can give you some specific language.)

The PUC should therefore keep DA intact and begin putting the ratemaking in place to enable DA, while achieving other important objectives (e.g., no cost-shifting, make sure bonds get serviced, etc.)

Paul and Jeff,

Becky, Donna and I (gas girls) met with Phillip Allen (ENA West) to discuss FERC gas issues today, and Phillip had some issues that were more state than federal, and I told him I would bring them to your attention.

He is interested in seeing incentive rates or more hedging on the part of the CA LDC's so that all their needs are not being served by the spot market.  In the current market, hedges (longer term contracting and financial) are being done primarily by the producers and marketers, which results in a thin and probably off-kilter market (the LDCs buying for the customers are not participating).  I know we have to square this with the EES positions, but I am not up to speed on what is going on in CA on this issue.

Phillip also made that point that while the LDCs are focusing on their core load, no one is doing system planning on the macro basis, taking into account the ability of the physical systems to meet the needs of all customers, core and non-core and making sure the system will be adequate.

Finally, he is very interested in seeing the CA LDC rates unbundled.

Any updates we can provide to Phillip (and the gas girls) would be appreciated, as well as what our plans are to address these issues.

From our side, El Paso is having a conference in July and we will be taking up a number of allocation and transportation issues at that time.

Thanks.",73,471

I think that the goal of Govt Affairs should be to (1) ensure that customers never on utility service post Jan 17 should not pay, and (2) try and find a compromise with the other parties to allow customers who leave by some date certain will only pay for the unrecovered cost  on a $/mwh basis.

Basically I am arguing that Enron should require DWR to calculate its unpaid balance on some date certain and determine the appropriate surcharge.   I know that this is a very long shot.  We should make this recommendation as a help to our business teams even if we are going to lose.

Do  we need a conference call with Lobbyists to work through this on Thursday?

cc:	Don Black, James D Steffes/NA/Enron@Enron, James W Lewis/HOU/EES@EES 

Subject:	Draft Bond Legislation Language

As discussed, we have two possible approaches:
1) Home Run Strategy: The following change: The commission shall, within 30 days from the date of the application, issue a bond financing order establishing a DWR Bond Charge that shall be applicable to all electric power delivered in California by electric corporations subject to the jurisdiction of the commission, with the exception of electric power delivered by suppliers other than the utility, who contracted for such delivery prior to the effective date of this legislation.
We use San Diego large customers as our example of customers who should be exempt from a surcharge because they have been off bundled rates for the duration of the turmoil.
Risk is that our customers will not be fully on until about August 15.  Thus if the wording gets changed to ""who are taking delivery as of the effective date of this legislation"" we have failed.
Positive is that it removes the CPUC (anti enron) discretion.

2) 1st Base Strategy: The following change: c) The commission shall conduct such proceedings as it deems necessary to inform the public of the revenue requirements  and to establish rates to enable the department to recover the revenue requirement.  Such rates will be designed  i) such that the bond revenue requirements will be recovered, and ii) to reflect the amount of DWR bond costs that the customer or customer class caused.
Risk is that the CPUC will interpret these words unfavorably to us.  ie.  If we touch the system once we pay the whole surcharge.

Harry.  I read through the proposed legislation.  In summary it:
Imposes a DWR Bond surcharge applicable to all electric power delivered in California .... subject to the jurisdiction of the commission.
The commission would approve the adjustments to the DWR Bond Charge as may be necessary to ensure timely recovery....
The commission would conduct hearings to establish rates to allow the DWR to recover their revenue requirements.
The DWR Bond Charge shall take precedence over all other costs and disbursements to be padi from the fund and shall be paid from revenue derived from rate levels in effect on July 31, 2001.

Although we could live with this legislation the issues I see are:
IBM would not escape a surcharge even though they may not have caused any DWR costs.
SImilarly, large San Diego customers, who have not caused any DWR costs, would be subject to a surcharge.
I am having a hard time understanding what they intended to achieve with the clause ""The DWR Bond Charge shall take precedence over all other costs and disbursements to be paid from the fund and shall be paid from revenue derived from rate levels in effect on July 31, 2001.""
Does the 2nd half of this sentence freeze the Jul 31, 2001 rates until the bond is paid off; or
Is it just an attempt to define that rates should not go up to pay for the bonds; or [this is the most likely meaning in my mind]
Is it just defining that the act comes into effect on July 31, 2001

If it is possible, we should advocate:
Regarding, SDG&E, customers who did not contribute to DWR costs:
Imposes a DWR Bond surcharge applicable to all electric power delivered in California .... subject to the jurisdiction of the commission.
The commission would conduct hearings to establish rates to allow the DWR to recover their revenue requirements.  Such rates will be designed  i) such that the bond revenue requirements will be recovered, and ii) to reflect the amount of DWR costs that the customer or customer class caused.

And we should get a legal interpretation of  ""The DWR Bond Charge shall take precedence over all other costs and disbursements to be paid from the fund and shall be paid from revenue derived from rate levels in effect on July 31, 2001.""  To make sure that we are not going to get surprised.

DA customers that have never purchased DWR power, call it amend. 1.  I also
agree with your proposal re customers that leave bundled service for direct
access service only having to pay for the costs actually incurred by DWR on
their behalf, call it amend. 2.  I think it is a stretch, however, to
propose an exemption for any customer that leaves bundled for DA by
September 1, call it amend. 3.  This appears to be inconsistent with amend.
2.  I agree with you re amend. 4, deletion of language ending DA.  Bill

Greetings:

Hope everyone had a pleasant 4th.

I've read the respective Burton and Hertzberg language on amending AB 1X.
The Burton language looks cleaner and simpler, though there may be reasons
to include some of the Hertzberg language, too.

I'm proposing to the group the following as potential amendments to the
bond bill.  I would appreciate your feedback.  The amendments would be as
follows:

   Customers who were on Direct Access when DWR started buying power (Jan.
   17th?), and are still on Direct Access when the bill passes, should be
   exempt from paying for the bonds.

In short, customers should not be forced to pay for power twice--once from
their ESP, and once from DWR.  Since these customers receive power services
from their ESP, they never consumed DWR power in the first place and it
wouldn't be fair to require them to pay for it.

   Customers who have been utility customers since DWR started buying power
   but subsequently switched to Direct Access should only pay for power
   provided by DWR that they actually consumed, no more and no less.

For example, if a customer was a utility customer when DWR started buying
power but switched to Direct Access on May 1st, then the customer would
only be responsible for reimbursing DWR for power deliveries that took
place from Jan. 17th thru April 30th.

I believe that we agreed on these concepts during the negotiations that
took place over the past 4-5 weeks.  Or if we didn't explicitly agree
during the talks, they seem to be principles on which we ought to be able
to agree pretty easily now. And rather than leave the issue hanging, which
can create unnecessary and costly uncertainty for customers, I suggest that
we include very clear and simple legislative language in the bond bill
clarifying what customers' obligations are.  Your thoughts are appreciated.

In addition, we have talked quite a bit about providing customers with
incentives in the attempt to get California out of the energy hole that it
finds itself in.  Providing (20KW and above) customers with an incentive to
switch to Direct Access as soon as possible could 1) reduce the net short
position that the state (and ultimately consumers) have to finance, thereby
reducing spot purchases and price volatility,  2) reduce electricity
purchasing costs, and 3) reduce the burden on the state budget.

With this in mind, I'm also proposing that the group consider an amendment
to the bond bill that would exempt from bond charges any customer that
switches to Direct Access by September 1st.

Finally, it seems odd that the language directing the PUC to suspend Direct
Access is still in the bill.  If a dedicated rate component is created,
that seems to eliminate altogether the need to suspend Direct Access.  And
if that's the case, would it make sense to delete that language from the
bill?

Look forward to your comments and working with you to get support for and
passage of the ""core/noncore"" proposal.

Jeff

Financial 
California Changes Stance on Refunds; Two Sides Far Apart In Energy Talks
Peter Behr","07/06/2001 
The Washington Post 
FINAL 
Page E01 
Copyright 2001, The Washington Post Co. All Rights Reserved 
California officials have abruptly shifted tactics in their attempt to recover billions of dollars in alleged overcharges for electricity , saying they may reduce their demands for huge refunds if generators renegotiate $43 billion in long-term electricity contracts that the state signed this year. 
Gov. Gray Davis (D) said part of the $8.9 billion in refunds the state is seeking could be offset by reductions in energy prices in the long-term contracts, whose costs have become a growing political embarrassment for Davis. 
""We've made suggestions, we've offered various ways in which people could get us $8.9 billion,"" Davis told the San Jose Mercury News in a report yesterday. ""You can renegotiate our existing contracts and save us money. However you want to do it, it's just got to net out close to $8.9 billion."" 
The new offer was introduced this week into the closed negotiations over a California settlement being conducted in Washington by Federal Energy Regulatory Commission Judge Curtis L. Wagner Jr., according to sources close to the negotiations. 
Yesterday, Wagner said he may issue his own preliminary finding today on the amount of overcharges if California officials and the generators cannot reach a compromise. 
""What I'm trying to do is get people in a settlement mood,"" Wagner told reporters. ""In the event we're unable to do that, [Friday] at some point I may offer a preliminary assessment."" The settlement conference is set to conclude on Monday. 
Wagner, FERC's chief administrative judge, has been trying to push both sides toward a compromise that would resolve the huge energy pricing controversy. Mountainous energy prices have bankrupted California 's largest utility, drained billions of dollars out of the state treasury and put Davis at sword's point with generators that help keep the state's lights on. 
Last Friday, Wagner rebuked Davis's chief representative, Michael Kahn, chairman of California Independent Grid Operator -- the state's power grid manager -- indicating that the state's demand for nearly $9 billion in refunds from power generators and marketers was too high, sources said. 
Wagner's settlement conference, which has involved more than 100 lawyers for all sides, is closed to the public and media. 
Wagner complained last month that Kahn was following a political agenda, and his lack of independence in the negotiations was such a ""joke"" that the parties might as well wear ""clown suits,"" according to a Dow Jones report confirmed by sources close to the talks. 
But he has also criticized the generators and power marketers, led by Reliant Energy Inc., Williams Energy Services, Duke Energy and Southern Co., for failing to make serious settlement offers, these sources said. The suppliers have offered to refund $600 million, provided the state is able to call off various California lawsuits demanding far larger refunds, sources said. 
Wagner's leverage is his ability to propose his own refund figure to FERC's commissioners. FERC has tentatively called for $124 million in refunds, but now is taking a harder line on preventing a new escalation of California 's electricity prices this summer and is likely to be receptive to a higher refund figure, some energy analysts believe. 
Davis's tactical change, offering to make the long-term contracts part of an overall settlement, comes amid growing criticism of what the state will have to pay for energy under those deals. 
California 's energy calamity stemmed in large part from its failed deregulation plan, which relied heavily on short-term power purchases at volatile ""spot market"" prices. When energy costs shot upward last summer, so did the state's electricity bills. 
In response, Davis's aide, S. David Freeman, and his staff began negotiating long-term power contacts with suppliers. The $43 billion in deals signed so far would require the state to pay about $70 per hour for a megawatt of power for a large part of the electricity it will need over the next 10 years. 
That's well under the average of $250 per megawatt-hour that the state was paying at the beginning of this year, but above current power prices -- and considerably higher than what electricity may cost in the next decade, energy analysts say. 
A new agreement to lower those contract prices could relieve political pressure on Davis and focus settlement negotiations away from the state's controversial demand for the $8.9 billion refund. Davis will argue that reducing future power charges that his administration negotiated should count as a ""refund"" because the deals were reached ""under commercial duress,"" according to sources close to Wagner's negotiations. 
Industry supporters say Davis's refund figure is impossible to justify. ""There's no benchmark for what a fair and reasonable price should be,"" said Michael Zenger, California director of Cambridge Energy Research Associates. 
The state's advocates counter that if FERC enforced a ""just and reasonable"" standard for power prices based on operating costs and a generous profit, the overcharges by all sellers could easily reach the $9 billion figure. 
""It's not rocket science, but it does require the regulators to regulate,"" said Frank Wolak, a Stanford University economist who heads an oversight committee for the California grid. 
Those polar-opposite views have left both sides in Wagner's conference room ""billions of dollars apart,"" as the talks approached their final weekend, sources said.",59,1137

The purpose of the meeting was to brief us on their activities and their gameplan for trying to find a solution for California.  Here's a summary of the meeting.  Please keep confidential.

Work will be done over the weekend to put the core/noncore proposal in legislative language.  (We will be in the room.)
Work done by the ""Plan B"" group in the Assembly (Joe Dutra and Joe Nation) will also be put into legislative language over the weekend.
Because no proposal is ""comprehensive,"" a complete legislative package will be created from the various pieces that have been worked on thus far (i.e., core/noncore, ""Plan B,"" Edison MOU)
In addition, there are Republican demands that Hertzberg will need to address (e.g., end the litigation) in order to achieve bi-partison support, which is what Hertzberg's shooting for. 
To move the legislation, the plan is to establish a ""conference committee,"" comprised of an equal number of Democrats and Republicans.
The committe would begin work on Monday and would attempt to finish putting a comprehensive bill together, vote it out of the Legislature and send it to the Governor for signing by Monday, July 16th.
July 16th is the deadline because that is the date that the PUC will issue its proposed decision regarding, among other things, how DWR's revenue requirement will be put into rates, whether Direct Access needs to be suspended, etc.
The PUC is issuing the draft on the 16th in order to give everyone 30 days to review and comment before the Commission votes on a final order on August 15th.  (The PUC will actually issue a ""thought piece"" on Monday the 9th and will use reactions to the ""thought piece"" to craft the develop the proposed decision it plans to issue on the 16th.)

FYI   Here is the language I gave Jeff to propose for an amendment to the
Sher Bond bill  which will make sure Direct Access customers don't pay for
DWR power costs through the bonds EXCEPT for power they actually used that
was purchased by DWR.  Houston has to ok this and then Jeff has to sell it.

I also strongly recommend that the next to the last sentence of Water Code
Section 80110 be repealed in the bill.  That would leave direct access in
place and force DWR to come to us to get a bill that would have reasonable
exit fee provisions.  Without a change like this, the bill would simply
reaffirm the ban on direct access and that could cause us to lose at the
Commission.  There is nothing else in the bill which explicitly tells the
PUC to not suspend direct access.

The group negotiating the core/noncore proposal met over the weekend to attempt to put the proposal into legislative language/format.  
The product produced thus far is generally sloppy and ill-drafted and the individual facilitating the group is working tonite to integrate the comments provided and discussions that took place today. He will  distribute a new draft by noon tomorrow (PDT).
The plan as it currently stands is to deliver a product to Hertzberg by COB tomorrow (Monday).
As expected, some in the group are attempting to ""recontract"" certain portions of the original deal, but those attempts are generally at the margin.
The DWR contracts remain a key impediment to any deal.
Senator Burton has still not definitively committed to a conference committee to produce a bill to deliver to Davis.
In addition, the legislation to create a dedicated rate component to service the bonds to repay the state budget for power purchased by DWR (and de-link the bonds from the DWR contracts) may be on a slower track than folks thought initially.
Will have more information tomorrow on where Burton and the bond legislation stand.

Here are my edits.  For simplicity, I accepted all the other changes and put mine in strike-out-underline.

They are confined to the direct access section, and to the provisions regarding ""spot market service"" in particular.  Based on our negotiations, I think it's accurate to state that spot market service was never discussed as ""an option to elect.""  Instead, the language in the agreement states that it is a ""backstop,"" in the event that on any given day a customer's ESP doesn't show up with the power.  In effect, it retains the utility's duty to serve, like the gas side, but does not expose the utility to any risk of cost recovery for the spot service provided.  I've also added provisions which obligate the utility to provide spot market service in the event that at the outset of the program (i.e., the transition date), the customer, for whatever reason fails to elect Term Service or Direct Access Service.  In both cases, the spot services lasts for a maximum of 30 days, after which the customer must choose Term or Direct Access Service.

Please take a look at the language.  While I haven't put any ""stakes in the ground"" up till now, I feel strongly about these changes (for reasons I'm happy to discuss), and if folks have issues with incorporating it into the document, I'd request that we have a very brief call to discuss.  I believe that the language as proposed captures my conversation with Dorothy.

In addition, I've also taken a stab at language requested by Delainey, i.e., ""what to do about DA in the interm?""  There may be better ways to craft the language, but I took a shot nonetheless.

Finally, I'm assuming, based on yesterday's call, that, by delivering this document to the Speaker today, no one is giving their approval, support, or anything else for each and every provision.  I'm not prepared to, and cannot, do that at this time.

Thanks again to all for all the effort (and to Dorothy for her patience in hearing me out earlier).

Any changes necessary to ensure no double counting are welcome.

Also, if 30 days seems to short to for some customers do strike a deal with either the utility or an ESP, then it might be appropriate, and I wouldn't object, to extending it to 90 days.  In my conversation with Dorothy, both 30 and 90 came up.  90 is reasonable, but it would seem to be the uppermost  limit.

I do not agree with Jeff's changes to Dorothy's language and I am not sure if Dorothy does.
In particular, I don't know what is meant by the language in the definition of Spot Market
Service which says ""and shall include all costs incurred by the electrical corporation to
provide retail electric service"" which seems to me to go way beyond even energy service.  I
am also concerned that there be no way that customers have to pay for A/S twice.

Second, I think 30 days is too short a time for a customer on Spot Market service to elect
DA or Term Service, since if the UDC is providing Term Service on a best efforts basis, that
option might not even be available within 30 days.  Barbara

In definition of spot market service, I would change 30 days to at least
90 days, not require the choice of there is no longer a competitive and
viable retail market, and maybe require the utility to come up with
something within that 90 day period.  I would also take out the language

SACRAMENTO -- California's energy meltdown involves a far more diverse group of wholesale electricity merchants than suggested by Gov. Gray Davis, who has aggressively blamed a handful of Texas companies, state records show. 
During the first three months of this year--one of the worst stretches of power shortages during the crisis--an assortment of public and private entities charged the state prices averaging well above some of those paid to Texas firms, according to documents released to The Times on Monday by the Department of Water Resources, which now buys power for California.
Among those setting and collecting some of the highest average prices per megawatt-hour were a Canadian public utility, a subsidiary of San Diego Gas & Electric's parent company, and the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, the report shows. Their average prices ranged from $498 a megawatt-hour charged by Powerex, the trading arm of British Columbia's BC Hydro, to $292 an hour by the DWP. 
In fact, some of the biggest private power companies singled out for criticism by Davis and other state officials--Dynegy Inc., Duke Energy and Mirant--charged less than the average prices the state paid for the period. Those companies' average prices ranged from $146 to $240 per megawatt-hour, according to an analysis of the documents. 
The figures cover the various types of spot and longer-term power purchased by the state during three months that included rolling blackouts and more than a month of razor-thin reserves, leading to continuous power emergencies. 
Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio said the governor has directed his sharpest barbs at private out-of-state generators because, in general, they have reaped the highest profits over the longest period. 
""You have to look at the whole picture,"" Maviglio said. 
""The governor was expressing his displeasure with the arrogance of the generators who wear cowboy hats,"" he said. ""Their profits were 100% to 400% above last year. . . . Just because there are other entities who are charging us more [per megawatt-hour] doesn't change the fact that we are getting ripped off by companies from Houston, Tulsa, Atlanta or Charlotte."" 
The report by the Department of Water Resources was provided to The Times on the same day the state released 1,700 pages of documents on California's electricity purchases on the volatile spot market for the year's first quarter. 
The records detail how the state spent nearly $8 billion buying power in the first five months of the year, and underscore the complexity of the state's energy problem. They also show that patterns of high prices are not limited to a few generators. 
Oscar Hidalgo, a spokesman for the water resources agency, said that the reports together show that prices were extremely volatile early in the year. ""All the prices were high,"" he said, noting the downward trend in costs since his agency began buying power in mid-January. 
The average price per megawatt-hour for all state purchases went from $316 in January to $243 in May. Spot prices fell from an average of $321 per hour to $271, the reports show. 
In the first quarter of the year, some public entities' prices far exceeded those of the biggest private companies. For example, Houston-based Enron, one of the nation's biggest power traders, charged an average of $181 per megawatt-hour. And Atlanta-based Mirant, which sold the most to the state, a total of $706 million, charged an average of $225 per megawatt-hour. 
By contrast, a Calgary, Canada, firm, TransAlta Energy, averaged $335 a megawatt-hour, and the Sacramento Municipal Utility District had average charges of $330 per megawatt-hour. 
A spokesman for Enron, Mark Palmer, said recently that the ""vilification of Enron was based on politics, not facts."" Spokesmen for BC Hydro could not be reached late Monday to comment on its huge sales to the state. In the past, the utility has defended its pricing practices, saying it has offered last-minute hydroelectric power that helped keep California's lights on. 
A spokeswoman for Sempra, the parent company of San Diego Gas & Electric, said late Monday the company was unable to comment because it had yet to see the figures released by the state. Officials at DWP, who could not be reached Monday evening, have defended their pricing, saying the costs of producing the power needed by the state were extremely high. 
More Power Bought Than Projected 
Hidalgo, of the Department of Water Resources, said his agency's efforts, coupled with conservation by business and consumers and falling natural gas prices, have begun to tame the state's market. 
Still, the state had to purchase $321 million in power in April and May, about 10% more than Davis' analysts had projected. 
Hidlago said that was because of hot weather in May and other supply problems in April. He said reports will show that power purchases fell short of state projections in June and early July. 
The reports also will show that prices paid by the state were down in June and July, partly because spot prices have fallen sharply, often to well under $100 a megawatt-hour. 
A summary Department of Water Resources report released Monday credited Davis' program of nurturing new power generation and establishing long-term power contracts with with ""moving the California electric energy industry closer to normalcy.""

Under the definition of ""Spot Market Service"" it now reads:

This service is available for Large Customers and Medium Customers whose service from a Direct Access provider has been interrupted, or who have failed to elect or be deemed to elect either Direct Access, Core Service or Term Service. 

I don't understand the meaning of the phrase ""or be deemed to elect.""  If inserting the phrase serves an important purpose, then perhaps it's appropriate to leave it in.  But we haven't discussed any reason for needing it.  As such, given the last-minute nature of the change, it should be deleted.

There is one heckuvalot of detail in the rate-related language that Edison provided that we didn't have a chance to discuss in our negotiations.  It may turn out that it's all fine, but I frankly haven't haven't had the chance to adequately wrap my meager mind around the language, so I just want to let folks know that many more comments on those pieces may pop up from my end in the near term.
Finally, I just want to raise a flag on section 25465 (a) (6) regarding the green portfolio standard.  We never discussed/analyzed those additional percentages and consequently we never established a ""zone of comfort"" around including those numbers.  That may become an issue (and may not, just wanted to briefly flag it).

Following last week's meeting, here is my recommendation on how to proceed with SCE. 

1.      Form Enron Negotiation Team 

        My recommendation is to use the same team we used with PG&E + Jeff Dasovich.  My understanding was that Lisa M. was the lead negotiator - I would not change this.  Jeff should only be there to make introductions.

2.      Meet & Confer (10/29) 

        Sue Mara and Jeff Dasovich will listen and report back to everyone on what happens.  

3.      Reformed Stipulation 

        I would propose that we take a wait and see approach to this document.  Based on Dasovich's idea to get together with SCE on Thursday, maybe let this ride.

4.      Meeting 

        My understanding is that (Jeff D. please correct) SCE can meet with us this Thursday.  Can everyone make it that needs to be there?  Probably meet in California.  We should put the laundry list on the table.

Please let me know what else we need to discuss or if anyone disagrees.
