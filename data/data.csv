Subject: EPC Limits of Liability

Kay - Ron Coker in the CTG group suggested you might be able to help with 
this.

ENA/SF is in the middle of negotiating the EPC contract for Pastoria (750 MW) 
with NEPCO.  We have hit a couple of snags in the contract and would very 
much appreciate your input as to what is ""market."" 

1. Limit of Liability -  NEPCO would like 80% up to Substantial Completion, 
40% up to Final Acceptance, and 10% for the Warranty Period.  GE's LOL is 
100% of their contract value though the warranty period. (which Kiewit also 
agreed to on Pittsburg.)
2. Retention - NEPCO would like to have 10% retention on payments only for 
the first 5% on the contract value and then 5% retention thereafter.  We 
would prefer 10% throughout the payment schedule.

What do you think?  We want the Owner's position to be as strong as possible 
to enhance the sale of the project, but NEPCO is under a great amount of 
pressure to reduce their contingent liability, and we really don't want to 
leave them holding the bag once we are gone if it is not necessary.

It's important to consider the precedent set by other similar projects, such as the GE contract referenced.\n\nGiven the importance of enhancing the project's saleability, it's crucial to carefully assess NEPCO's motivations and priorities.

Subject: EPC Limits of Liability

Kay - Ron Coker in the CTG group suggested you might be able to help with 
this.

ENA/SF is in the middle of negotiating the EPC contract for Pastoria (750 MW) 
with NEPCO.  We have hit a couple of snags in the contract and would very 
much appreciate your input as to what is ""market."" 

1. Limit of Liability -  NEPCO would like 80% up to Substantial Completion, 
40% up to Final Acceptance, and 10% for the Warranty Period.  GE's LOL is 
100% of their contract value though the warranty period. (which Kiewit also 
agreed to on Pittsburg.)
2. Retention - NEPCO would like to have 10% retention on payments only for 
the first 5% on the contract value and then 5% retention thereafter.  We 
would prefer 10% throughout the payment schedule.

What do you think?  We want the Owner's position to be as strong as possible 
to enhance the sale of the project, but NEPCO is under a great amount of 
pressure to reduce their contingent liability, and we really don't want to 
leave them holding the bag once we are gone if it is not necessary.

- NEPCO's proposed limits of liability and retention seem more typical for a cost-plus contract, not a lump sum deal

Dean - 

I think NEPCO's proposed limits of liability and retention are way more typical of a cost-plus contract, not a lump sum deal like this one. The 80/40/10% structure is pretty aggressive, especially the 10% during the warranty period. Unless there are some carve-outs or other concessions, I'm not sure why they'd need that much protection. The GE contract and the dollar value of their equipment might be factors that come into play here. Want to discuss this further and see if I can help? 

Kay","Here's the generated email:

Dean,

I just got your note about the EPC contract for Pastoria. Thanks for reaching out. I've got some thoughts on the limits of liability and retention.

NEPCO's proposal seems more in line with a cost-plus contract, not a lump sum deal like this one. It looks like they're being pretty aggressive on both fronts. I'm especially surprised by the 10% limit of liability during the warranty period - that's steep unless there are some carve-outs or other concessions to justify it.

The GE contract and the dollar value of their equipment might also play a role in determining the limits of liability. Have you considered that? I'd be happy to chat more about this and help if you need it.

Let me know if you'd like to discuss this further.

Dean, 

I think NEPCO's proposed limits of liability and retention are more in line with a cost-plus contract, not a lump sum deal. Their approach to both seems aggressive, especially the 10% limit of liability during the warranty period - unless there are carve-outs or other concessions that justify it. The treatment of the GE contract and the dollar value of the GE equipment may be factors that impact the limits of liability. Let's discuss this further and see if we can find a middle ground that works for both parties. 

Best, Kay","Here is the generated email:

They are a bit aggressive, and this was for a cost plus contract.  In any 
case, the dollar value of the Ge equipment ought to count.  I don't have the 
contract in front of me, so I can't provide any specific details on carve 
outs or any other elements.

I would be happy to talk to you about it.

I'm not sure why they think this is appropriate for a lump sum deal.  The 
treatment of GE and the dollar value of the GE equipment might be factors that 
impact the LOL.  Unless there are some concessions or carveouts that would make 
the 10% work, I think they are pretty aggressive.  

Dean, can you call me Monday and we can discuss this as well as the 
indemnification discussions that Sheila has been having with NEPCO.

","Okay! I understand! I will think about the sender, receiver, date, subject, the prior context, and the intention of the sender, and then provide some rules.
<rules>

1. **Email Length**: The email should be between 5-6 sentences long, with a concise and direct tone.
2. **Tone**: The tone should be direct and concise, with a focus on conveying necessary information without unnecessary phrases or words.
3. **Structure**: The email should not have a traditional greeting or introduction, and should get straight to the point.
4. **Language**: Use a conversational tone, with a focus on simplicity and clarity.
5. **Nicknames**: Use the nickname ""CT"" instead of ""you"" to address the recipient.
6. **Punctuation**: Use concise punctuation, such as periods and commas, to separate ideas and sentences.
7. **Word Choice**: Avoid using formal or overly polite language, and opt for more conversational and direct phrases.
8. **Focus**: The email should focus on conveying necessary information, such as attending the meeting and informing Tom Gros, rather than using filler phrases or words.
9. **Sentence Structure**: Use simple and concise sentence structures, with a focus on getting the point across quickly.
10. **Transition**: The email should use a clear transition between ideas, such as using phrases like ""And then"" to connect sentences.

By following these rules, the baseline email can be transformed into a more concise and direct email that matches the tone and style of the ground truth email.</rules>","Okay! I understand! I will think about the sender, receiver, date, subject, the prior context, and the intention of the sender, and then provide some rules.
<rules>

To ensure that the baseline email can be transformed into the ground truth email, the following rules should be applied:

1. **Length**: The email should be concise and have a length of around 5-6 sentences.
2. **Tone**: The tone should be formal and direct, avoiding casual phrases and polite language.
3. **Structure**: The email should be structured into 3-4 concise sentences, followed by a brief introduction of the topic and a request for the recipient's attendance.
4. **Language**: Avoid using slang, abbreviations, and overly polite language. Use formal and concise language instead.
5. **Formality**: Use formal greetings and sign-offs, such as ""Dear Bob"" and ""Sincerely"".
6. **Get straight to the point**: Avoid using phrases like ""I'm excited to have you join the meeting"" and ""I believe it's important for us to discuss"" and get straight to the point.
7. **Avoid unnecessary phrases**: Phrases like ""I'd love to have you as my guest"" can be removed to make the email more concise.
8. **Use active voice**: Use active voice instead of passive voice to make the email more direct and concise.
9. **Remove unnecessary words**: Remove words like ""wanted"" and ""I believe"" to make the email more concise.
10. **Keep it simple**: Avoid using complex sentences and try to keep the email simple and easy to understand.

By applying these rules, the baseline email can be transformed into the ground truth email, resulting in a more concise, formal, and direct email that effectively conveys the intended message.</rules>","<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>

Bob,

I'm glad you were ready to go.  (I didn't even have to twist your arm).  
We're going to advance, and the best we can do is a nice 
handoff.  Of course, your handoff to whatever person will get some 
significant purging as well.  That being said, we are retaining Tom Gros, 
so  don't call him, bother to leave voice mail, etc.

I'm going to tell Tom that you'll be our liaison with CommodityLogic for Energy 
Operations.  As a courtesy, I recommend that we both go, and afterwards 
you can review what we talked about and keep on the schedule.  Then, you'll 
be off and running on your own.  Good luck.

Let me know if there's a problem with getting there, and I'll send out an 
apologies or do whatever.

Thanks,

Sally

David, Sally (and Chris):

I can't believe that I missed throwing out the first pitch with the Enron
Commercial Team.  I heard it was a perfect pitch (and had no chance of
getting hit !!!)

You must have all gotten a big kick out of seeing Skip Pardue and his
beautiful family sitting right behind home plate (with the tickets that I
had reserved for myself).

Well, I'll try to make the next event (which I believe is on May 17).  Hope
to see you there.

Mark

- I've finally received an update from the traders regarding deal 565759.01

- The original 25 mw peak deal was cut by 10 mw each hour, resulting in 15 mw and some scraps being sold in each hour

","Hey Steph, got the scoop on deal 565759.01 - ISO cut Idaho's schedule on Sunday, so we had to reduce our sale to them. Instead of 25 mw peak, we did 15 mw + scraps in each hour, and sold the rest in hour-ahead market (pretty standard when ISO cuts schedules). Does that sound like an issue to you, KP?","Here is the generated email:

Hi Stephanie,

I finally got an update from the traders on deal 565759.01. So, it turns out the ISO cut Idaho's schedule on Sunday, which meant we had to reduce our sale to them. The original 25 mw peak deal got cut by 10 mw each hour, leaving us with 15 mw and some scraps to sell in each hour. We ended up selling the remaining schedule in the hour-ahead market, which is pretty standard practice when the ISO cuts schedules.

Just wanted to confirm if this change is going to cause any issues. If it does, I'm open to finding a solution. Let me know your thoughts.

Thanks,
Kate","Here is the generated email:

Hey Stephanie,

Originally, we had a 25 mw peak deal, but they cut it by 10 mw each hour, leaving us with 15 mw and some scraps in each hour.

I just heard from the traders and it looks like this deal was affected by the 
ISO cutting Idaho's schedule on Sunday, so we had to reduce our sale.  So the 
original 25 mw peak deal was cut 10 mw each hour, leaving 15mw and some scraps 
in the hour ahead market. This is a standard operating procedure when the 
ISO cuts schedules.

Will this mess anything up?  Maybe we can work something out?

Thanks,

Kate

Don:

Attached please find the latest version of the Agreement in Word format,
together with a blackline (Word file ""BL 565759"") showing changes made to
the draft I provided yesterday.  Please note the following agreements
reached with the purchaser:

a)  The purchaser will pay an incentive fee of $250,000, payable
immediately upon execution of the Agreement, and an additional
incentive fee of $125,000 upon commercial operations.  The
commercial operations date will be based upon commercial operation of
the Weston facility, which will serve as the ""lead"" facility.  We are
still working to finalize the definition of commercial operations, but
it will be based upon a period of stable operation (i.e., not just
achievment of a single hour of operation).  The Agreement allows for
the commercial operations date to be adjusted backwards in time in the
event that the facility is placed in ""standby"" service prior to actual
commercial operation, and we are working to add language to this effect
to the Agreement.

b)  The purchaser has agreed to purchase 7.5 MW of capacity through
2010 (with appropriate reductions based upon the output of the Weston
facility), which should provide a stable cash flow stream.

c)  In exchange for these concessions, the purchaser agreed to
eliminate the output guarantees and quantity provisions from the
Agreement.  As you know, these provisions were consistently problematic
in our negotiations with the purchaser, and we are glad to be able to
report that they have yielded to our position on these issues.

As we discussed during our telephone conference earlier this week, I have
included a number of open issues in the Agreement, including (i) the
exercise price for the equity, (ii) the date by which Enron must deliver
the Notice to Proceed, (iii) the scope of information to be included in
the Data Room, (iv) the scope of due diligence permitted by the purchaser
pursuant to the Agreement, and (v) the nature, scope and timing of
commercial operations.  With respect to commercial operations, as noted
above, we are still working to finalize the definition of commercial
operations, and will need to add appropriate language to the Agreement in
this regard.  Additionally, as discussed earlier, we will need to
confer with GE with respect to the Agreement and commercial operations,
although this should not be a difficult or time-consuming task.

As we discussed in our telephone conference, I am eager to confer with
you
and the transaction team to discuss the Agreement in its current form,
as well as the Data Room, which was delivered to the purchaser earlier
this week.  Please let me know at your earliest convenience whether you
would like to confer this week, and if so, the times at which you are
available.  If you are unable to confer this week, please let me know the
times at which you are available thereafter.  I may be reached via email
at loricope@akllp.com, or at (202"

The structure should remain similar, but with a focus on brevity and clarity.\n5. Nicknames should not be used, but if necessary, use first names in specific contexts.\n6. Slangs and abbreviations should not be used, unless essential for clarity.\n7. The tone should be more personal and conversational, using a more casual language.\n8.

Hi Susan,

I'm familiar with the EOL access request you submitted, and I'd like to discuss it with you before approving it. As you recall, I mentioned in our staff meeting on Monday that I'm being more cautious with these approvals. Wouldn't it be better if we reviewed the request together to ensure everything is in order? 

Specifically, I think Susan M Scott needs to complete the request form by adding her manager's name, and the manager should also approve it. Let's touch base on Friday morning when we meet to finalize this. 

Thanks,
Sally Beck","Here's an email that meets the given rules and intent:

Hey Susan, just got this request for EOL access and I'd love to discuss it with you first. As you know, I've been more cautious with these approvals lately, so want to make sure we're on the same page. Can we chat about it on Friday morning when we meet? Also, can you get your manager to approve this and add their name to the request form?","I wanted to touch base with you about the security resource request from Susan M Scott for EOL - Backoffice (US) access. As you know, I mentioned in our staff meeting on Monday that I'm being more cautious with these approvals lately. Before I give the green light, I'd like to discuss it with you first. Can we talk more about this on Friday morning when we meet? Also, I noticed that Susan still needs to add her manager's name to the request form, and the manager should approve it as well.","Here is the generated email:

I'm familiar with Susan and could do this, but I want to talk to you about it. 

We discussed during our staff meeting on Monday that I am going to be a little more careful about who gets access. 

We can discuss this further on Friday am when we meet.  

Susan needs to fill out the request form by putting in the name of her manager, and her manager also needs to do the same.

Thanks, Sally

This is the true amount that Enron is buying back from Allied.

mainline to leach to allied = 12809/12426/12163
tco pool to allied  = 2898/2837

Total delivery cut  = 12163+2837 = 15,000
Total at pool  = 12426+2898 = 15,324

By golly.... the 15,000 grossed up is 15,324. Chris, thinking you want the 
15,324 on the ticket for the 5 days. John ... do you agree too?!?!  The deal 
ticket is 225366.

Total reduced to Allied Plant:

This is the true amount that Enron is buying back from Allied.

mainline to leach to allied = 12809/12426/12163
tco pool to allied  = 2898/2837

Total delivery cut  = 12163+2837 = 15,000
Total at pool  = 12426+2898 = 15,324

By golly.... the 15,000 grossed up is 15,324. Chris, thinking you want the 
15,324 on the ticket for the 5 days. John ... do you agree too?!?!  The deal 
ticket is 225366.

6. **Price**: The price (GD - $.005) should not be mentioned explicitly.
7. **Grammar and punctuation**: The email should use informal language, with shorter sentences and minimal punctuation.
8. **Formalities**: The email should not include formal phrases like ""Best regards"" or ""I hope this email finds you well"".
9. **Conciseness**: The email should be as concise as possible, with a focus on conveying the essential information quickly and efficiently.

By following these rules, the baseline email can be transformed into the ground truth email, ensuring a more accurate and concise representation of the original message.

","Okay! I understand! I will think about the sender, receiver, date, subject, the prior context, and the intention of the sender, and then provide some rules.
<rules>

To transform the baseline email into the ground truth email, the following rules should be applied:

1. **Tone and style**: Adopt a more casual and conversational tone, using phrases like ""Hope this helps confirm"" and ""Thanks for asking"".
2. **Length**: The email should be shorter, ideally between 3-4 sentences.
3. **Language**: Use informal language and phrases, such as ""As you suggested"" instead of ""I appreciated"".
4. **Sentence structure**: Use shorter, more concise sentences to convey the same information as the baseline email.
5. **Nickname**: Use ""Rick's Staff Mtg"" as a nickname for the meeting, instead of the full name ""Rick Causey's CAO Staff Meeting"".
6. **Abbreviations**: Avoid using abbreviations like ""EB46C1"", instead use ""EB 46C 1"" as written in the ground truth email.
7. **Context**: Assume the recipient is already familiar with the meeting details, and only mention the date and location.
8. **Conversational phrases**: Use phrases like ""I'm so grateful for the prayers"" and ""Please don't hesitate to call me if you need any thing else"" to create a more conversational tone.
9. **Sentence order**: Rearrange the sentences to create a more conversational flow, such as starting with the personal update about the father's health.
10. **Signing off**: Use a more casual sign-off, such as ""Sally"" instead of ""Best, Sally Beck"".
11. **Remove unnecessary sentences**: Remove sentences that are not essential to conveying the main points, such as ""In order to ensure a smooth hand off after you finish, I want to give you some background"".

By applying these rules, the baseline email can be transformed into an email that is more concise, conversational, and similar in tone and style to the ground truth email.</rules>","Okay!

7. **Abbreviations**: No abbreviations should be used in the email, except for standard business email abbreviations such as ""Corp."" for ""Corporation"".
8. **Nuances**: The email should convey a sense of familiarity and rapport with the recipient, using phrases and language that convey a personal touch.
9. **Formalities**: The email should avoid formal greetings and sign-offs, instead opting for a more conversational tone.
