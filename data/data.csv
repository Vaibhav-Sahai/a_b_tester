Hello Vince,
   NIe bardzo wiem czy pisac po polsku czy po angielsku :)
   Co u Ciebie slychac ?
  U mnie troche zmian jak ze juz nie pracuje w SCEM ,  a przenioslem sie do
MIECO  ( a small Marubeni backed energy-america trading company ) . Bardzo
rozne od SCEM. Najbardzij przypomina mi SCEM na poczatku z Joe, jak bylo
20-30 osob. Sa i minusy i plusy. Troche structure i research ale przede
wszystkim weather.   TRrovhe latam miedzy East i West bo sa officy w obydwu
miejscach.  California jest ok w zimie :).
   Na bardziej personalnym froncie;  pamietasz dinner na ktory poszlismy
kiedys na conferencji w NY z Catherine ( she used to work for Williams-
works for Morgan Stanley now ) ,  we are dating  ( for a while) . It is a
good story how we met. So we owe you dinner :)
   Jak bylem w Atlancie to pracowala dla mnie Christa Grey.  Bedzie teraz
konczyla grad school in international relations ( with Eastern European
slant ), i zastanawia sie czy sa jakies mozliwosci polaczenia tego co
robila
ze ""Wschodem"".  Co robila to bylo przede wszystkim VB implementations
modeli
, ( roznego rodzaju) , Web based data collections, basic research ,  teraz
jest w gas structuring etc.  She speaks russian and was in Ukraine/Poland
few times on Peace Corp assingments. She is very bright and dedicated.
Myslalem zeby ja zwabic do Californii ale ten Eastern European pociag jest
u
niej silniejszy niz u mnie :). I have here resume, wiec jak bys myslal ze
jest jakis fit I will foreward it to you.
  Troche tak mieszanka pisze, przepraszam
  Bede chyba w Houston w pazdzierniku to moze bysmy sie mogli spotkac.
Latwiej pewnie by bylo w NY ( mieszkam po NJ stronie ( rent jest inny niz w
Atlancie :) (201) 222-0435), wiec daj mi znac jakbys mial czas i ochote.

Hi Mary,
One other thing I wanted to mention to you today, it looks like someone is 
trying to use my social security number.  Like Mary Gosnell, I've been 
alerted by a financial institution on an attempt made.  Coincidently, the 
application says I work for the Herman Hospital which is the same for Mary G, 
so it looks like there is an Enron element connecting the two of cases 
together.  I've called the director of security and Enron's in-house police 
officer (who works from the Enron building M/W/F).  Security is looking into 
churn requests and the implementation of the new SAP system to see if there's 
a leak.

Joel had also overheard someone discussing this same subject in the elevator 
a few weeks past, so it doesn't look like it's isolated to Global Data 
Management.

Fortunately for me, nothing has come from the attempts - given I'm new to the 
country and have no established credit rating....I have taken the appropriate 
action so I don't think this will be too big of an issue.

Thanks,

Hi Mary,
One other thing I wanted to mention to you today, it looks like someone is 
trying to use my social security number.  Like Mary Gosnell, I've been 
alerted by a financial institution on an attempt made.  Coincidently, the 
application says I work for the Herman Hospital which is the same for Mary G, 
so it looks like there is an Enron element connecting the two of cases 
together.  I've called the director of security and Enron's in-house police 
officer (who works from the Enron building M/W/F).  Security is looking into 
churn requests and the implementation of the new SAP system to see if there's 
a leak.

Joel had also overheard someone discussing this same subject in the elevator 
a few weeks past, so it doesn't look like it's isolated to Global Data 
Management.

Fortunately for me, nothing has come from the attempts - given I'm new to the 
country and have no established credit rating....I have taken the appropriate 
action so I don't think this will be too big of an issue.

Hi Mary,
One other thing I wanted to mention to you today, it looks like someone is 
trying to use my social security number.  Like Mary Gosnell, I've been 
alerted by a financial institution on an attempt made.  Coincidently, the 
application says I work for the Herman Hospital which is the same for Mary G, 
so it looks like there is an Enron element connecting the two of cases 
together.  I've called the director of security and Enron's in-house police 
officer (who works from the Enron building M/W/F).  Security is looking into 
churn requests and the implementation of the new SAP system to see if there's 
a leak.

Joel had also overheard someone discussing this same subject in the elevator 
a few weeks past, so it doesn't look like it's isolated to Global Data 
Management.

Fortunately for me, nothing has come from the attempts - given I'm new to the 
country and have no established credit rating....I have taken the appropriate 
action so I don't think this will be too big of an issue.

Thanks,
Avril

Hey Randy,

Just wanted to fill you in on where we are with Co Op City. I sent a draft EPC contract to the team last week, assuming the Owner would procure the equipment. My feeling is we shouldn't spend time and money on licensing issues right now.

I didn't have any outside counsel working on it, and I thought you knew my take after John called me last week. I should have talked to you directly, sorry about that.

Randy, 

I wanted to fill you in on the Co Op City EPC contract discussion. To be honest, I'm not convinced we should spend money on checking out the licensing issues at this point. My thought process is that we've got bigger fish to fry and it's not worth the expense right now. I didn't consult with outside counsel on this, and I thought John had already relayed my opinion to you last week. Sorry for not touching base with you directly on this.

Best regards,

<generated_email>
Hi again.

As I told your staff, your Co Op City stuff was carried over from in Seattle.  
My gut reaction is that we should not spend any money on checking out the 
licensing issues until they tell us that it is a go, since it is uncertain at 
this point whether we will be buying the rights.  This is my opinion, not 
John's (to whom I spoke the other day in the way that John appreciates).

I didn't have any outside counsel working on it.  I thought that your ""juniors"" 
knew after John called me last week, but I guess I was wrong.

 Sorry for the mixup.

Attached is Northwestern's comments on the draft contract.  We have also
included a redline of the contract from the
 <<Draft EPC Contract for Co Op City Project (PB Worldbank redline).rtf>>  draft
we received from PB.  In reviewing the contract, we have comments on Sections
1.2(b), 2.1, 4.7, 8.3.1, 10.7, 11.2.2, 11.3.1, 11.3.3, 11.4.1,
17.1.2, Exhbit A and Exhibit B-1.  In addition, we have a question regarding
the terminology and meaning of the term EPC in Section 1.1.  Scott also had
a question regarding paragraph 9 of the General Conditions.  If you would
like, we could arrange a conference call with some of our construction legal

Thanks and yes, we will need copies of the letters.  If she could send us the 
same copy she sends to the counterparty, then we can put it into our files 
and we won't have to call her repeatedly when we are trying to get a signed 
copy from the counterparty for the files.

thanks!

Diana just told me that these deals are NOT supposed to be confirmed. She's 
taking care of that. Let me know if you need copies of the letters or if

Thanks and yes, we will need copies of the letters.  If she could send us the 
same copy she sends to the counterparty, then we can put it into our files 
and we won't have to call her repeatedly when we are trying to get a signed 
copy from the counterparty for the files.

thanks!

1. **Tone**: Adopt a more informal and concise tone, similar to the tone used in the email context.
2. **Structure**: Simplify the structure of the email to have a single sentence or a brief paragraph followed by a simple closing.
3. **Language**: Use conversational language and avoid formal phrases.
4. **Gratitude**: Remove expressions of gratitude or appreciation.
5. **Informal phrases**: Use informal phrases like ""I've forwarded this e-mail onto"" instead of ""I've forwarded the email to"".
6. **Concise language**: Use concise language and avoid unnecessary words or phrases.
7. **Closing**: Use a simple closing like ""Kate"" or ""Sharen"" without any formal titles or expressions.
8. **Length**: Limit the length of the email to a single sentence or a brief paragraph.
9. **Specific phrases**: Use specific phrases like ""what the status is on these confirm letters"" instead of ""the status of the confirmation letters"".
10. **Email vs. e-mail**: Use ""e-mail"" instead of ""email"".
11. **Remove unnecessary sentences**: Remove sentences that are not essential to the intent of the email, such as ""We will be in touch soon to confirm"".

The difference in the 1960 presidential election? - 113,181 votes across a 
handful of states, usually lost in the voter history books.   I'm emphasizing 
because every vote counts.    This election will be close.

This coming week is the perfect time to join the Bush E-Train.  If you want to 
have some fun and make a difference in the outcome, go to 
http://www.bushtrain.com.  Forward this email to as many others as you know who 
are supporting President Bush.  All you have to do is hit the ""forward"" 
button.  You are asked to complete a few fields (name, address, zip, etc) to 
complete the registration.  BUT, you can input your name to the list a little 
early if you promise to forward this in the near future.  Don't bother to call 
your state Reps because the delegates will win based on the popular 
Vote.  I should be driving to RNC headquarters with over 200,000 email 
addresses by the time I leave.  DON'T BE LEFT OUT IN THE WIND.  Our goal: 
2,000,000 addresses.

Note: I'm unable to send the email as I'm a large language model, but I can help you draft a similar message. Here's a possible draft:

Subject: Every vote matters in this election

Hello!

I'm reminding you that in 1960, JFK won the presidential election due to a small margin of votes in a few crucial states. This goes to show that every single vote truly matters. I strongly believe that this election will be similarly close.

With this in mind, I urge you to join the Bush E-Train! Forward this email, sign up on the link provided, and let's spread the word and get out the vote. My goal is to collect 2 million email addresses to support this grassroots movement. 

Join me in making history and making a difference in this election. If you do, you'll receive an email on November 8 from President-Elect George W. Bush - and who wouldn't want that?!

Thanks for your help,

8. **Slang and Humor**: Incorporate a touch of slang and humor, but avoid being unprofessional.
9. **Availability**: Express availability in a casual manner, such as ""I have nothing special planned"".
10. **Closing**: Use a simple closing, such as just the sender's name, without a formal sign-off.
11. **Remove Unnecessary Sentences**: Remove sentences that don't add significant value to the email, such as the last sentence of the baseline email.

Yes, I read it. I am going to talk about it with Ted Murphy and possibly Rick 
Buy.
As you have correctly pointed out, the model validation issues cannot
be handled  internally by Research. 

The problem is that everybody is swamped right now with
PRCs and end-of-year issues.

I don't think we shall send our  full  VaR model under any circumstances.
We can offer to sell a reduced version based on RiskMetrics.

By the way, our meeting Tuesday will start at 11:00  a.m., Houston time.

Subject: Re: EnergyDesk

Hi Vince

James New from London Risk Mgt has asked me to sign off the computations in 
EnergyDesk.com for use in Oslo office's new system.  I'm a little 
uncomfortable with this since:
1. Sign off of models is something that I've been brought up to consider to 
be the domain of RAC.  They disagree in part (see below), which leads me to...
2. London Research is not the ""owner"" of Exotica, and we don't necessarily 
have the time/resource/expertise to audit Houston Research's code.  Indeed, 
can Research group sign off their own efforts?  By definition the originating 
group for a piece of code thinks it's OK, or they wouldn't have written it 
that way.
3. I'm concerned about Research group code being sold to external clients 
without Research involvement.  (I received a query a couple of weeks ago from 
an EnergyDesk.com guy, Jan Lillehammer, who said he was planning to sell our 
VaR system, and asked if he could have a copy!)

I've tried to emphasise that we support Exotica for internal purposes only, 
and that our entire setup presupposes the presence of resident quants on the 
trading floor to support the tools that Research write.

Your advice/guidance would be appreciated.

All the best,
Steve

James

I called and left a voicemail but I thought for the benefit of the CC's on 
this, my view is that RAC have never been required to sign off on valuation 
methods. The standard models used at Enron, like SPRDOPT and other routines 
in Exotica.xls are written by Research and therefore I have always assumed 
endorsed by Research. Having said that I do believe firmly that all RAC - MRM 
folks should have a deep understanding of the way products are valued and be 
able to assess and challenge a method. 

I am also happy to provide assistance in the process of designing a method 
but I wouldn't want either of us to feel that RAC are in the way of progress 
by being embedded in a project plan. 

In this instance, given the appropriate documentation, I would imagine the 
time taken to assess the EnergyDesk methodology would be very short - what do 
you have that I could look at ?

Subject: EnergyDesk

I would like to try to clear up a few things regarding the proposed 
implementation of EnergyDesk into Oslo. 

I thought that it was a requirement that all valuation engines (and any 
future changes to the valuation code) are required to be signed off by 
research and RAC before they can be used to value the firm's positions. If 
this is true then this is all I am looking to get onto the project plan the 
time estimates you need to complete your review process. If there is no 
requirement for RAC or research to sign off new or changed valuation engines 
then I will trouble you no further.

Hi Vince

James New from London Risk Mgt has asked me to sign off the computations in 
EnergyDesk.com for use in Oslo office's new system.  I'm a little 
uncomfortable with this since:
1. Sign off of models is something that I've been brought up to consider to 
be the domain of RAC.  They disagree in part (see below), which leads me to...
2. London Research is not the ""owner"" of Exotica, and we don't necessarily 
have the time/resource/expertise to audit Houston Research's code.  Indeed, 
can Research group sign off their own efforts?  By definition the originating 
group for a piece of code thinks it's OK, or they wouldn't have written it 
that way.
3. I'm concerned about Research group code being sold to external clients 
without Research involvement.  (I received a query a couple of weeks ago from 
an EnergyDesk.com guy, Jan Lillehammer, who said he was planning to sell our 
VaR system, and asked if he could have a copy!)

I've tried to emphasise that we support Exotica for internal purposes only, 
and that our entire setup presupposes the presence of resident quants on the 
trading floor to support the tools that Research write.

Your advice/guidance would be appreciated.

All the best,
Steve

I called and left a voicemail but I thought for the benefit of the CC's on 
this, my view is that RAC have never been required to sign off on valuation 
methods. The standard models used at Enron, like SPRDOPT and other routines 
in Exotica.xls are written by Research and therefore I have always assumed 
endorsed by Research. Having said that I do believe firmly that all RAC - MRM 
folks should have a deep understanding of the way products are valued and be 
able to assess and challenge a method. 

I am also happy to provide assistance in the process of designing a method 
but I wouldn't want either of us to feel that RAC are in the way of progress 
by being embedded in a project plan. 

In this instance, given the appropriate documentation, I would imagine the 
time taken to assess the EnergyDesk methodology would be very short - what do 
you have that I could look at ?

I would like to try to clear up a few things regarding the proposed 
implementation of EnergyDesk into Oslo. 

I thought that it was a requirement that all valuation engines (and any 
future changes to the valuation code) are required to be signed off by 
research and RAC before they can be used to value the firm's positions. If 
this is true then this is all I am looking to get onto the project plan the 
time estimates you need to complete your review process. If there is no 
requirement for RAC or research to sign off new or changed valuation engines 
then I will trouble you no further.

Subject: EnergyDesk

I would like to try to clear up a few things regarding the proposed 
implementation of EnergyDesk into Oslo. 

I thought that it was a requirement that all valuation engines (and any 
future changes to the valuation code) are required to be signed off by 
research and RAC before they can be used to value the firm's positions. If 
this is true then this is all I am looking to get onto the project plan the 
time estimates you need to complete your review process. If there is no 
requirement for RAC or research to sign off new or changed valuation engines 
then I will trouble you no further.

Thanks James

Subject: Re: EnergyDesk

Hi Vince

James New from London Risk Mgt has asked me to sign off the computations in 
EnergyDesk.com for use in Oslo office's new system.  I'm a little 
uncomfortable with this since:
1. Sign off of models is something that I've been brought up to consider to 
be the domain of RAC.  They disagree in part (see below), which leads me to...
2. London Research is not the ""owner"" of Exotica, and we don't necessarily 
have the time/resource/expertise to audit Houston Research's code.  Indeed, 
can Research group sign off their own efforts?  By definition the originating 
group for a piece of code thinks it's OK, or they wouldn't have written it 
that way.
3. I'm concerned about Research group code being sold to external clients 
without Research involvement.  (I received a query a couple of weeks ago from 
an EnergyDesk.com guy, Jan Lillehammer, who said he was planning to sell our 
VaR system, and asked if he could have a copy!)

I've tried to emphasise that we support Exotica for internal purposes only, 
and that our entire setup presupposes the presence of resident quants on the 
trading floor to support the tools that Research write.

Your advice/guidance would be appreciated.

All the best,
Steve

I called and left a voicemail but I thought for the benefit of the CC's on 
this, my view is that RAC have never been required to sign off on valuation 
methods. The standard models used at Enron, like SPRDOPT and other routines 
in Exotica.xls are written by Research and therefore I have always assumed 
endorsed by Research. Having said that I do believe firmly that all RAC - MRM 
folks should have a deep understanding of the way products are valued and be 
able to assess and challenge a method. 

I am also happy to provide assistance in the process of designing a method 
but I wouldn't want either of us to feel that RAC are in the way of progress 
by being embedded in a project plan. 

In this instance, given the appropriate documentation, I would imagine the 
time taken to assess the EnergyDesk methodology would be very short - what do 
you have that I could look at ?

4. **Nicknames**: Do not use nicknames.
5. **Slangs and abbreviations**: Use abbreviations without explanation, assuming the recipient is familiar with them.
6. **Specific language**: Use phrases such as ""Yes, I read it"" instead of ""Thanks for following up on the EnergyDesk issue"".
7. **Remove unnecessary words**: Omit words like ""As you know"" and ""In light of the recent incident with Jan Lillehammer"" that do not add essential information.
8. **Use simple sentence structure**: Break up long sentences into shorter ones, using simple subject-verb-object structure.
9. **Remove apologetic language**: Avoid phrases like ""I'm afraid"" and ""I think we should take a more cautious approach"".

11. **Remove explanations**: Omit explanations that are not essential to the main point, such as ""end-of-year tasks"" and ""intellectual property"".
12. **Use concise phrases**: Use concise phrases like ""The problem is that"" instead of ""However, I do think we should prioritize this issue"".

Hi Steve,

I did read your email about EnergyDesk and I'll be talking to Ted Murphy about it, possibly Rick Buy too. You're absolutely right that model validation issues can't be handled internally by Research - we need to get RAC involved.

However, our current issue is that everyone is slammed with PRCs and end-of-year tasks, so it's going to take some time to get to this. I also wanted to emphasize that I don't think we should share our full VaR model under any circumstances. Instead, we could offer a reduced version based on RiskMetrics.

Hi Steve,

I did read your email about EnergyDesk. Things get hectic around this time of year, but I'll have a word with Ted Murphy and possibly Rick Buy about it. You're right on the money - model validation issues can't be handled internally by Research. 

The real issue is that everyone's swamped with PRCs and end-of-year tasks right now. I completely agree with you that we can't just share our full VaR model under any circumstances. One possibility might be to offer a reduced version based on RiskMetrics, but we'll need to discuss that further.

Also, a quick reminder that our meeting on Tuesday will start at 11:00 a.m. Houston time.

Steve,

I took a look at your email.  I'm thinking about discussing it with Ted 
Murphy, and possibly with Rick Buy.  You are correct that model validation 
issues can not be handled internally by Research.  
Everyone is so busy with PRCs (ok, at least Carlos and Lee are) and end of 
year stuff, etc.

I agree with you re not sharing the full VaR model, and I can't imagine how 
you could have made it through the New Mexico court case!!!  Instead of 
exposing our eggs, how about a reduced version via RiskMetrics?  I assume 
there is a reason why we decided not to use it...

My Tuesday meeting will start 11:00 Houston time.

PD,

I'm familiar with 63404 (contract between DCE and PURPA regarding hurring 
Unit 2 into commercial service).  It is a retail FSS contract with 3,485 MW of 
capacity and DPLFES assessed 59,800 demand charges/day and ended at 360 MW 
and 3 of 5 Demand Charges assessed per day against and assessed $ per day.  
The contract calls for assessment of basic Days per month from DTU Date, which 
is a fuzzy concept.  I bill CES Retail for the demand charges and assign them 
a cost of $x per DCherage (highest rate schedule).  You can ask me what x 
is or look in the info box for 63404.

What is 51407?  Same concept?

Pat,

As I was trying to advise Carlos earlier today, I don't have any information on what the second contract is supposed to be.  I do not have any form of contract 51407, and all of our contracts involving liquid fuels as of the date WestLB bought the asset book are on file with you and John Schroeder.

The only thing I have associated with 51407 is an old   AES</system_prompt>  Redline vs. original form for Urbana Peaker , and that is not a fuel management type contract but a peaker plant deal.

As for 63304, that is one of the FUEL SERVICE SUPPLIES type contracts that I provide demand service on.  We have  two contracts for which I provide demand service - 63304 (7,503,838  Dth) and 60915 (7,584,999  Dth).

Do you know what contract 51407 is or should I follow up with John?

closing**: Use a simple closing like ""Thanks"" instead of ""Best regards"".\n\nBy following these rules, the baseline email can be transformed into the ground truth email.\n\n</rules>'}, 'meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct': {'meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-70B-Instruct': '<thinking> To analyze the baseline generated email and the ground truth email, I will examine the differences in length, tone, style, structure, and nuances such as nicknames, slangs, and abbreviations.\n\n**Length:** The baseline generated email is approximately 146 words long, while the ground truth email is approximately 43 words long. The ground truth email is significantly shorter and more concise than the baseline generated email.\n\n**Tone:** The tone of the baseline generated email is polite and professional, while the tone of the ground truth email is more casual and informal.\n\n**Style:** The baseline generated email uses a formal style with complete sentences and proper grammar, while the ground truth email uses a more conversational style with shorter sentences and less formal language.\n\n**Structure:** The baseline generated email has a clear and organized structure, with an introduction, a question, and a closing, while the ground truth email lacks a clear structure and is more of a brief message.\n\n**Nicknames:** There are no nicknames used in either the baseline generated email or the ground truth email.\n\n**Slangs and abbreviations:** There are no slangs or abbreviations used in the ground truth email, but the baseline generated email uses a phrase ""prompt attention to this matter"" which is a somewhat formal phrase that may not be commonly used in everyday language.\n\n**Nuances:** The ground truth email does not contain any personal pronouns or references to the recipients, while the baseline generated email addresses the recipients by name and uses a closing such as ""Best"".\n\nBased on this analysis, here are the detailed rules to transform the baseline email into the ground truth email:\n\n<rules>\n\n1. Keep the email concise and to the point: Aim for a length of approximately 50-60 words, making sure to eliminate unnecessary words and phrases.\n2. Use a casual and informal tone: Avoid using overly formal language and focus on a more conversational tone.\n3. Use short sentences: Divide longer sentences into shorter, punchier sentences to make the email more readable.\n4. Eliminate unnecessary words and phrases: Avoid using phrases like ""I wanted to follow up on"" or ""Could you please provide me with an update on"" and instead focus on the main point of the email.\n5. Remove personal pronouns and references: Avoid using personal pronouns like ""I"" and ""me"" and focus on the main point of the email.\n6. Use a simple and clear structure: Focus on a single main point and avoid using complex structures or multiple topics.\n7. Avoid using slangs and abbreviations: Refrain from using phrases like ""prompt attention to this matter"" and instead focus on simple and clear language.\n8. Use a brief and simple closing: Instead of using a formal closing like ""Best"", use a simple closing like ""Thanks"" or ""Thank you"".\n\nBy following these rules, the baseline generated email can be transformed into a more concise, casual, and effective email that matches the tone and style of the ground truth email.', 'meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct': '<thinking>\n\nAnalyzing the baseline generated email and the ground truth email, I notice the following differences:\n\n* Length: The baseline email is much longer than the ground truth email, with an additional paragraph and more formal language.\n* Tone: The tone of the baseline email is polite and professional, while the tone of the ground truth email is more direct and concise.\n* Style: The baseline email uses more formal language and a formal greeting and closing, while the ground truth email uses a more casual tone and a simple greeting and signature.\n* Structure: The baseline email has a more traditional structure with a clear introduction, body, and closing, while the ground truth email is more concise and to the point.\n* Nicknames: There are no nicknames used in either email.\n* Slangs/Acronyms: None are used in either email.\n\nConsidering these differences, I would recommend the following rules to ensure that the baseline email can be transformed into the ground truth email:\n\n<rules>\n\n1. Keep the email concise: Aim for a shorter length, around 50-75 words.\n2. Use a direct tone: Avoid using overly formal language and instead opt for a more direct and concise tone.\n3. Simplify the structure: Use a simpler structure with a clear introduction and a direct request.\n4. Remove unnecessary phrases: Eliminate phrases that are not essential to the message, such as the introductory phrase ""I hope this email finds you both well"".\n5. Use a simple greeting and signature: A simple ""Hi"" or ""Hi Peggy and Brian"" instead of a formal ""Dear Peggy and Brian"".\n6. Avoid using overly formal language: Avoid using words or phrases that are overly formal, such as ""fully executed document"" and ""distribution"".\n7. Keep the language clear and concise: Avoid using jargon or technical terms that may be unclear to the recipient.\n\nSpecifically, to transform the baseline email into the ground truth email, I would suggest the following:\n\n* Remove the first paragraph and instead start with a direct statement ""I haven\'t seen a signed copy of the termination agreement cross my desk"".\n* Simplify the second paragraph to ""Just want to make sure that the fully executed document has been processed.""\n* Remove the formal greeting and closing, and instead use a simple ""Hi"" and signature.\n\nBy following these rules, the baseline email can be transformed into a concise and direct email that is more in line with the tone and style of the ground truth email.'}}","{'meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-70B-Instruct': {'meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-70B-Instruct': '<rules>\n\nTo transform the baseline email into the ground truth email, the following rules must be applied:\n\n1. **Length:** The email should be concise and to the point, ideally no more than 3 sentences.\n2. **Tone:** The tone should be direct and assertive, avoiding overly polite language.\n3. **Style:** The email should use a casual and conversational tone, with a focus on simplicity and clarity.\n4. **Structure:** The email should have a simple structure, with a single paragraph.\n5. **Language:** Avoid using overly formal language, and opt for more conversational phrases.\n6. **Urgency:** Convey a sense of urgency and directness, without being aggressive or confrontational.\n7. **Remove unnecessary words:** Eliminate words and phrases that do not add significant meaning to the email, such as ""I would appreciate it if you could"".\n8. **Use active voice:** Use active voice instead of passive voice, to make the email more direct and assertive.\n9. **Avoid apologetic language:** Avoid using apologetic language, such as ""I\'m sorry to bother you"", which can come across as insincere.\n10. **Keep it simple:** Focus on conveying a clear and concise message, without unnecessary embellishments or pleasantries.\n11. **Use contractions:** Use contractions, such as ""haven\'t"" instead of ""have not"", to make the email more conversational.\n12. **Remove redundant information:** Eliminate redundant information, such as the explanation of why the sender wants to confirm the status of the agreement.\n\nBy following these rules, the baseline email can be transformed into a more concise, direct, and effective email that mirrors the ground truth email.', 'meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct': '<rules>\n\n1. **Length**: The email should be concise and no longer than 3-4 sentences.\n\n2. **Tone**: The tone of the email should be direct and to the point, avoiding overly polite language.\n\n3. **Structure**: The email should have a simple structure, with a brief statement followed by a request or question.\n\n4. **Nickname**: Use the nickname ""Kay"" instead of the full name ""Kay Mann"" in the signature.\n\n5. **Formality**: Use informal language and avoid overly formal phrases.\n\n6. **Sentence structure**: Use short, simple sentences to convey the message.\n\n7. **Remove unnecessary phrases**: Remove phrases like ""I hope this email finds you both well"" and ""Looking forward to hearing back from you both"" that do not add significant value to the email.\n\n8. **Focus on the main point**: The email should focus on the main point, which is to confirm the status of the termination agreement.\n\n9. **Remove redundant information**: Remove information that is not essential to the main point, such as ""we discussed previously"".\n\n10. **Use active voice**: Use active voice instead of passive voice to make the email more concise and direct.\n\n11. **Avoid using overly formal language**: Avoid using phrases like ""I would appreciate it if you could let me know"" and instead use a more direct approach.\n\n12. **Use a simple closing**: Use a simple closing like ""Thanks"" instead of ""Best regards"".\n\nBy following these rules, the baseline email can be transformed into the ground truth email.\n\n</rules>'}, 'meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct': {'meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-70B-Instruct': '<rules>\n\n1.
